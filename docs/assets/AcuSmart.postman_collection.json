Book\\n   Options give investors so much flexibility that when it came to writing a book named\\n   The Bible of Options Strategies, I found myself cursing just how flexible they can be!\\n   Sixty strategies is a lot of ground to cover, but in reviewing them all again (I’ve done\\n   it several times already!), I was reminded of the beauty of these amazing trading\\n   instruments.\\n       Options give us the ability to do so many things—they enable us to configure our\\n   investment aims in any way we like. The benefits of options are often trotted out to\\n   new students or prospective customers as the first salvo of an up-sell campaign, but\\n   they’re worth looking at again, this time from a practical point of view.\\n       Options enable us to:\\n    ■   Control more assets for less money.\\n        One option contract represents 100 shares of stock and is usually a fraction of the\\n        cost of what you’d pay for the equivalent number of shares.\\n        For example, ABCD stock is priced at $26.20 on June 2, 2004.\\n        An option to buy ABCD shares (a call option) might be priced at $2.60. Because\\n        one contract represents 100 shares, we can therefore buy one ABCD call contract\\n        for $260.00 [100 * 2.60]. The alternative would be to buy 100 shares of the stock\\n        for a total sum of $2,620. So, in this example, we can buy ABCD calls options for\\n        around 10% of the stock price in order to control $2,620 of ABCD stock until the\\n        appropriate expiration date of the option.\\n    ■   Trade with leverage.\\n        Because our cost basis is so low, the position is much more sensitive to the under-\\n        lying stock’s price movements, and hence our percentage returns can be so much\\n        greater.\\n    ■   Trade for income.\\n        We can design strategies specifically for the purpose of generating income on a\\n        regular basis.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 448,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 32,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/32.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"       ■   Profit from declining stocks.\\n           We can use puts and calls to ensure that we can make money if the stock goes up,\\n           down, or sideways.\\n       ■   Profit from volatility or protection against various factors.\\n           Different options strategies protect us or enable us to benefit from factors such as\\n           time decay, volatility, lack of volatility, and more.\\n       ■   Reduce or eliminate risk.\\n           Options enable us to substantially reduce our risk of trading, and in certain rare\\n           cases, we can even eliminate risk altogether, albeit with the trade-off of very lim-\\n           ited profit potential!\\n      So, with all the different benefits of options, why on earth would traders not be curi-\\n      ous to learn more about them? Well, for a start, the initial barrier to entry is quite\\n      high, in that options are reasonably complex instruments to understand for the first\\n      time. After you’re over that hurdle, though, they become more and more fascinating!\\n      The other reason is that there is such a multitude of other investment securities for\\n      people to choose from, many will pick what seems like the simplest, rather than what\\n      may fit their investment aims the best.\\n          Given that options can be a challenge, it’s my job to make life as simple as possi-\\n      ble for you. One of the ways in which I do this is to break things down into pictures\\n      so we can see what we’re doing. As soon as we can see what we’re doing, life\\n      becomes much clearer when you’re creating options strategies. Everything to do\\n      with OptionEasy and all my material is designed to be visual-friendly. This goes back\\n      to when I started to learn all about options and the fact that the penny only started\\n      to drop when I converted the concepts into pictures. All of a sudden, everything fit\\n      into place, and I started to be able to extend logic faster and further than before.\\n          This book is designed to be a reference book, one that you can pick up any time\\n      to learn about and understand a strategy. It isn’t an academic workbook. It’s a prac-\\n      tical book, written for traders, designed to work interactively with your trading\\n      activities. As the title suggests, it’s a book about options strategies, of which we take\\n      on 58! That’s not to say you need to learn about each and every one of them, but at\\n      least you have the choice!\\n          In order to make life easier for you, we categorize the strategies into different\\n      descriptions for the following criteria:\\nProficiency Level\\n      Each strategy is assigned a “value” in term of its suitability for different levels of\\n      trader. Each level is given an associated icon.\\n                                 Strategies suitable for novices\\n                                 Strategies suitable for intermediates\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 449,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 33,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/33.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"                                Strategies suitable for advanced traders\\n                                Strategies suitable for expert traders\\n      The allocations are defined according to a subjective view of complexity, risk, and\\n      desirability of the strategy. Therefore, some highly risky and undesirable strategies\\n      have been put into the Expert basket in order to warn novices and intermediates away.\\n      Also Novice strategies are not exclusive to novice traders. It’s simply as question of\\n      suitability, and novice strategies are highly relevant and suitable to all levels of trader.\\n           In some cases, the strategy is not complex at all but is considered unacceptably\\n      risky for novice and intermediate traders (at least without a warning). I have tried to\\n      be objective here, but I’m mindful not just of my own experiences but also the many\\n      students who regularly show me their trading disasters! Conservative by nature,\\n      I’m a believer that loss of opportunity is preferable to loss of capital (Joe DiNapoli), and\\n      perhaps some of these rankings bear testimony to this philosophy.\\nMarket Outlook\\n      This is where we define whether a strategy is suitable to bullish, bearish, or direction\\n      neutral outlooks.\\n                                Strategies suitable for bullish market conditions\\n                                Strategies suitable for bearish market conditions\\n                                Strategies suitable for sideways market conditions\\nVolatility\\n      Volatility is one of the most important factors affecting option pricing and therefore\\n      option trading. You really should familiarize yourself with the concept, which, for-\\n      give the plug, is dealt with in my first book, Options Made Easy.\\n           Here, we define whether a strategy is suitable for trades anticipating high volatil-\\n      ity or low volatility in the markets. Some strategies, such as Straddles, require high\\n      volatility after you’ve placed the trade, so a Straddle would fall into the High\\n      Volatility category.\\n                                Strategies suitable for high volatility markets\\n                                Strategies suitable for low volatility markets\\nRisk\\n      With any trade you’re looking to make, you must be aware of your potential risk,\\n      reward, and breakeven point(s).\\n           Some strategies have unlimited risk; others have limited risk, even if that “limited”\\n      risk means 100% of the trade. Believe it or not, sometimes with options it’s possible to\\n      lose more than 100%. In such cases, or when there is no definable stop to the potential\\n      risk of a trade, you’re well advised to be aware of such a position in advance!\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 450,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 34,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/34.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"           Here, we show you which strategies have capped or uncapped risk.

Often you can mitigate such risk with a simple stop loss\\n      provision, in which case you’re not going to liable to uncapped risk.

Inevitably there’s some overlap between chapters for certain strate-\\n     gies, which we address in the appropriate places.\\n         Chapter 1 addresses the basic strategies, including buying and selling stocks and\\n     then buying and selling calls and puts.

All strategy guides are modular and follow\\n     the same format, so that you can become familiar with the style and structure of the\\n     content.\\n         Chapter 2 is all about income strategies. An income strategy is when you’re effec-\\n     tively a net seller of short-term options, which generates (monthly) income. You have\\n     to be careful, though, not to expose yourself to unlimited risk scenarios, which is\\n     why we use icons to identify excess risk.\\n         In Chapter 3, we cover “vertical spreads.” A vertical spread is where we buy and\\n     sell the same numbers of the same options (calls or puts) but with different strike\\n     prices. Obviously, there’s some overlap here with other chapters, which is why the\\n     chapter is comparatively small.\\n         Chapter 4 goes into volatility strategies and is bound to be as popular as the\\n     income strategies chapter!

For example, we can\\n     replicate owning a stock purely by buying and selling calls and puts in such a way\\n     that we hardly pay any cash out. In other words, we’ve simulated the risk of owning\\n     the stock, but with no cash outlay. We can also synthetically re-create straddle posi-\\n     tions and other strategies.\\n         Lastly, in Chapter 8, we investigate some of the taxation issues that will confront\\n     you during your trading careers.

The Greeks are as follows:\\n              Delta:\\n              The movement of the option position relative to the movement of the under-\\n              lying (say, stock) position. The resulting figure gives us an indication of the\\n              speed at which the option position is moving relative to the underlying stock\\n              position. Therefore, a Delta of 1 means the option position is moving 1 point\\n              for every point the stock moves. A Delta of –1 means the option position is\\n              moving –1 point for every point the underlying stock moves.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 453,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 37,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/37.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"    Typically, at-the-money options move with a Delta of 0.5 for calls and –0.5\\nfor puts, meaning that ATM options move half a point for every 1 point that\\nthe underlying asset moves. This does not mean the option leg is moving\\nslower in percentage terms, just in terms of dollar for dollar.\\n    Delta is another way of expressing the probability of an option expiring\\nin-the-money. This makes sense because an ATM call option has a Delta of\\n0.5; i.e., 50%, meaning a 50% chance of expiring ITM. A deep ITM call will\\nhave a Delta of near 1, or 100%, meaning a near 100% chance of expiration\\nITM. A very out-of-the-money call option will have a Delta of close to zero,\\nmeaning a near zero chance of expiring ITM.\\n    So, Delta can be interpreted both in terms of the speed of the position and\\nthe probability of an option expiring ITM. Some advanced traders like to\\ntrade with the sum of their portfolio Delta at zero, otherwise known as Delta-\\nNeutral trading. This is by no means a risk-free method of trading, but it is a\\nstyle that enables profits to be taken regardless of the direction of market\\nmovement. However, this is only really suited to professional-style traders\\nwho have the very best technology solutions and a lot of experience.\\nGamma:\\nGamma is mathematically the second derivative of Delta and can be viewed\\nin two ways: either as the acceleration of the option position relative to the\\nunderlying stock price, or as the odds of a change in probability of the posi-\\ntion expiring ITM (in other words, the odds of a change in Delta). Gamma is\\neffectively an early warning to the fact that Delta could be about to change.\\nBoth calls and puts have positive Gammas. Typically, deep OTM and deep\\nITM options have near zero Gamma because the odds of a change in Delta are\\nvery low. Logically, Gamma tends to peak around the strike price.\\nTheta:\\nTheta stands for the option position’s sensitivity to time decay. Long options\\n(i.e., options that you have bought) have negative Theta, meaning that every\\nday you own that option, time decay is eroding the Time Value portion of the\\noption’s value. In other words, time decay is hurting the position of an option\\nholder. When you short options, Theta is positive, indicating that time decay\\nis helping the option writer’s position.\\nVega:\\nVega stands for the option position’s sensitivity to volatility. Options tend to\\nincrease in value when the underlying stock’s volatility increases. So, volatil-\\nity helps the owner of an option and hurts the writer of an option. Vega is pos-\\nitive for long option positions and negative for short option positions.\\nRho:\\nRho stands for the option position’s sensitivity to interest rates. A positive Rho\\nmeans that higher interest rates are helping the position, and a negative Rho\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 454,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 38,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/38.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"              means that higher interest rates are hurting the position.

The examples are all taken\\n              from real stocks using real data. However, because they are intended to be\\n              objectively indicative of how the strategies work, I have renamed the stock\\n              “ABCD” for every example.

The multi-\\n     tables of contents are designed so that you can find the appropriate strategy easily,\\n     without having to thumb your way through the entire book to get there first.\\n     Familiarize yourself with this area because it’s going to save you a lot of time as you\\n     use it later on.

For example, “Trading Plan” is referred to\\n     throughout the guides and is defined in the Glossary.\\n         As options traders, we should definitely acquaint ourselves with the concepts of\\n     fundamental and technical analysis. Fundamental analysis involves the interpreta-\\n     tion of how economies, sectors, and individual corporations are performing in terms\\n     of assets, liabilities, revenues, and profits.\\n         Technical analysis involves the interpretation of price charts for securities. We\\n     really should understand the basic chart patterns such as pennants, flags, head and\\n     shoulders, support, resistance, and Fibonacci retracements. Remember, an option is\\n     a derivative—it is derived from an underlying security. Therefore, it makes sense for us\\n     to understand how that underlying security is likely to move and why.\\n         I hope you enjoy this reference book and use it for many years to come.

Therefore, if time decay hurts us when we buy\\noptions, it must help us when we sell options. Because time value decreases (or time\\ndecay increases) exponentially during the last month to expiration, we typically\\ndon’t like to own options into that last month, but we do like to sell options with one\\nmonth left to expiration.\\n   With these four strategies, we would buy calls and puts with at least three\\nmonths (or more) left to expiration, thereby looking for the options to increase in\\nvalue during that time.\\n   We would short calls and puts with a month or less to expiration, thereby look-\\ning for short-term income as the option hopefully expires worthless.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 460,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 44,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/44.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"The Four Basic Options Risk Profiles\\n       Imagine that the dotted lines are mirrors and see how each strategy is the opposite\\n       of the one on the other side of the mirror.\\nBuying a Call                                     Buying a Put\\n■ Belief that stock will rise (bullish outlook)   ■ Belief that stock will fall (bearish outlook)\\n■ Risk limited to premium paid                    ■ Risk limited to premium paid\\n■ Unlimited maximum reward                        ■ Unlimited maximum reward up to the strike\\n                                                    price less the premium paid\\nWriting a Call                                    Writing a Put\\n■ Belief that stock will fall (bearish outlook)   ■ Belief that stock will rise (bullish outlook)\\n■ Maximum reward limited to premium               ■ Risk “unlimited” to a maximum equating to\\n  received                                          the strike price less the premium received\\n■ Risk potentially unlimited (as stock price      ■ Maximum reward limited to the premium\\n  rises)                                            received\\n■ Can be combined with another position to        ■ Can be combined with another position to\\n  limit the risk                                    limit the risk\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 461,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 45,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/45.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"                                                            The Four Basic Options Strategies     5\\n1.1 Long Call\\nProficiency     Direction     Volatility  Asset Legs     Max Risk      Max Reward   Strategy Type\\n                              N/A                         !\\nNovice          Bullish                   Long Call      Capped        Uncapped     Capital Gain\\n1.1.1 Description\\n        Buying a call is the most basic of all option strategies. For many people, it constitutes\\n        their first options trade after gaining experience buying and selling stocks.\\n           Calls are easy to understand. A call is an option to buy, so it stands to reason that\\n        when you buy a call, you’re hoping that the underlying share price will rise.\\n        ITM             In the Money               stock \\u0001 call strike price\\n        ATM             At the Money               stock \\u0002 call strike price\\n        OTM             Out of the Money           stock \\u0003 call strike price\\n        Buy call\\nSteps to Trading a Long Call\\n        1. Buy the call option.\\n            ■    Remember that for option contracts in the U.S., one contract is for 100\\n                 shares. So when you see a price of $1.00 for a call, you will have to pay\\n                 $100 for one contract.\\n            ■    For S&P Futures options, one contract is exercisable into one futures con-\\n                 tract.

Do\\n          ensure that you give yourself enough time to be right; this means you should\\n          go at least six months out, if not one- or two-year LEAPs.

A Short Call exposes us to\\n        uncapped risk if the stock rises meteorically, and brokers will only allow experi-\\n        enced options traders to trade the strategy in the first place.\\n            A call is an option to buy, so it stands to reason that when you buy a call, you’re\\n        hoping that the underlying share price will rise. If you’re selling or shorting a call,\\n        it’s therefore logical that you’d want the stock to do the opposite—fall.\\n        Sell call\\nSteps to Trading a Short Call\\n        1. Sell the call option with a strike price higher than the current stock price.\\n             ■    Remember that for option contracts in the U.S., one contract is for 100\\n                  shares. So when you see a price of $1.00 for a call, you will receive $100 for\\n                  one contract.\\n             Steps In\\n             ■    Try to ensure that the trend is downward or rangebound and identify a\\n                  clear area of resistance.\\n             Steps Out\\n             ■    Manage your position according to the rules defined in your Trading Plan.\\n             ■    Hopefully the stock will decline or remain static, allowing your sold option\\n                  to expire worthless so you can keep the entire premium.\\n             ■    If the stock rises above your stop loss, then exit the position by buying back\\n                  the calls.\\n             ■    Time decay will be eroding the value of your call every day, so all other\\n                  things being equal, the call you sold will be declining in value every day,\\n                  allowing you to buy it back for less than you bought it for, unless the\\n                  underlying stock has risen of course.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 466,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 50,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/50.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"1.2.2 Context\\nOutlook\\n       ■  Bearish—You are expecting a fall in the stock price; you are certainly not\\n          expecting a rise in the stock.\\nRationale\\n       ■  To pick up short-term premium income as the stock develops price weakness.\\nNet Position\\n       ■  This is a net credit transaction because you are receiving a premium for the\\n          call.\\n       ■  Your maximum risk is uncapped.\\n       ■  Your maximum reward is capped to the price you receive for the call.\\nEffect of Time Decay\\n       ■  Time decay is helpful to your naked sold option, so take advantage of the max-\\n          imum time erosion.

Buy the put option.\\n          ■ Remember that for option contracts in the U.S., one contract is for 100\\n              shares. So when you see a price of $1.00 for a put, you will have to pay\\n              $100 for one contract.\\n          ■   For S&P Futures options, one contract is exercisable into one futures con-\\n              tract. If the option price is $1.00, you will pay $250 for one futures contract\\n              upon exercise.\\n         Steps In\\n          ■   Try to ensure that the trend is downward and identify a clear area of\\n              resistance.\\n         Steps Out\\n          ■   Manage your position according to the rules defined in your Trading Plan.\\n          ■   Sell your long options before the final month before expiration if you want\\n              to avoid the effects of time decay.\\n          ■   If the stock rises above your stop loss, then exit by selling the puts.\\n1.3.2 Context\\nOutlook\\n       ■  With a Long Put, your outlook is bearish. You expect a fall in the underlying\\n          asset price.\\nRationale\\n       ■  To make a better return than if you had simply sold short the stock itself. Do\\n          ensure that you give yourself enough time to be right; this means you should\\n          go at least six months out, if not one or two year LEAPs.

You will see that\\n          LEAPs and longer-term options are far better value per month, and they give\\n          you more time to be right, thus improving your chances of success. Another\\n          method is to buy only deep ITM options.\\nNet Position\\n       ■  This is a net debit transaction because you pay for the put option.\\n       ■  Your maximum risk is capped to the price you pay for the put.\\n       ■  Your maximum reward is uncapped until the stock falls to zero, whereupon\\n          the maximum profit is the strike price less what you paid for the put.\\nEffect of Time Decay\\n       ■  Time decay works against your bought option, so give yourself plenty of time\\n          to be right.\\n       ■  Don’t be fooled by the false economy that shorter options are cheaper.\\n          Compare a one-month option to a 12-month option and divide the longer\\n          option price by 12.

Income strategies are char-\\n     acterized typically by being short-term strategies, whereby option premium is sold\\n     on a monthly basis. Many investors generate significant percentage returns in this\\n     way, even if the underlying stock hasn’t moved. Imagine collecting income when\\n     your chosen stock hasn’t even moved at all.\\n        As with all aspects of trading, it’s crucial to be level-headed and not to get greedy.\\n     A 3–4% return every month is very significant when compounded to an annual rate.\\n     Would you take a 30% return on your money every year? Of course you would . . .\\n     or at least you should! I know you aspire for more, and that’s ok, but remember that\\n     fund managers would kill for such returns, though remember that they are fettered\\n     by all kinds of regulatory and compliance criteria that the private investor never has\\n     to worry about.\\n        The basic income strategies outlined here can be employed by traders of all lev-\\n     els and experience. Don’t get hung up on thinking that complex strategies must\\n     yield higher returns. That simply isn’t the case. Higher returns are generated by\\n     good trading plans that are consistently executed time after time. Some of the great-\\n     est traders execute the same simple processes over and over again. The challenge\\n     they have is to keep their enthusiasm up year after year.\\n        In short, there is nothing wrong with choosing a Covered Call as your staple strat-\\n     egy, and don’t let “option snobs” tell you otherwise! Naked Puts are also incredibly\\n     simple, but unless you have sufficient experience (and collateral in your account!), a\\n     broker may not let you trade them because of the perceived risk. In such a case, you\\n     can create a Bull Put Spread by buying a lower strike put, which will have the effect\\n     of capping the risk of the Naked Put.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 478,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 62,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/62.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"Income Strategies Staircase\\n           This diagram shows how the various income strategies link together, highlighting\\n           their similarities and differences.

If the stock falls, you have the cushion of the call premium\\n        you collected.\\n           On occasion, it’s attractive to sell an In the Money or At the Money call while you\\n        already own the stock. In such cases, the premium you collect will be higher, as will\\n        the likelihood of exercise, meaning you’ll end up delivering the stock at the strike\\n        price of the sold call.\\n        Buy stock                             Sell OTM call                           Covered Call\\nSteps to Trading a Covered Call\\n        1. Buy (or own) the stock.\\n        2. Sell calls one or two strike prices out of the money [OTM] (i.e., calls with strike\\n            prices one or two strikes price higher than the stock).\\n            ■     If the stock is purchased simultaneously with writing the call contract, the\\n                  strategy is commonly referred to as a “buy-write.”\\n            ■     Generally, only sell the calls on a monthly basis. In this way you will cap-\\n                  ture more in premiums over several months, provided you are not exer-\\n                  cised. Selling premium every month will net you more over a period of\\n                  time than selling premium a long way out.

Time decay is\\n              at its fastest rate in the last 20 trading days (i.e., the last month), so when\\n              you sell option premiums, it is best to sell them with a month left, and do it\\n              again the following month.\\n         ■    Remember that your maximum gain is capped when the stock reaches the\\n              level of the call’s strike price.\\n         ■    If trading U.S. stocks and options, you will be required to buy (or be long\\n              in) 100 shares for every options contract that you sell.\\n         Steps In\\n         ■    Some traders prefer to select stocks between $10.00 and $50.00, considering\\n              that above $50.00, it would be expensive to buy the stock.

You can increase your\\n          yield by purchasing the stock on margin, thereby doubling your yield if you\\n          use 50% margin.\\n       ■  Your maximum risk is the price you paid for the stock less the premium you\\n          received for the call.\\nEffect of Time Decay\\n       ■  Time decay is helpful to your trade here because it should erode the value of\\n          the call you sold. Provided that the stock does not hit the strike price at expira-\\n          tion, you will be able to retain the entire option premium for the trade, thus\\n          reducing your original cost of buying the share.\\nAppropriate Time Period to Trade\\n       ■  Sell the calls on a monthly basis.\\nSelecting the Stock\\n       ■  Choose from stocks with adequate liquidity, preferably over 500,000 Average\\n          Daily Volume (ADV).\\n       ■  Select a stock price range you feel comfortable with.

It is, in fact, the combination of a Bull Put Spread and a Bear\\n      Call Spread. The higher strike put shares the same strike as the lower strike call to\\n      create the butterfly shape. The combination of two income strategies also makes this\\n      an income strategy. Often, traders will leg into the Long Iron Butterfly, first trading\\n      a Bull Put Spread just below support and then as the stock rebounds off resistance\\n      adding a Bear Call Spread, thereby creating the Long Iron Butterfly.\\n          Ideally the stock will remain between the lower and higher strikes, with the max-\\n      imum profit occurring if the options expire when the stock is priced at the central\\n      strike price. In this ideal scenario, effectively all the options expire worthless, and\\n      you just keep the combined net credit. The combined net credit serves to widen the\\n      area of your breakevens—in other words, the Bull Put element helps the Bear Call\\n      element, and vice versa.\\n      Buy lower              Sell middle  Sell middle           Buy higher             Long Iron\\n      strike put             strike put   strike call           strike call            Butterfly\\nSteps to Trading a Long Iron Butterfly\\n      1. Buy one lower strike (OTM) put.\\n      2. Sell one middle strike (ATM) put.\\n      3. Sell one middle strike (ATM) call.\\n      4. Buy one higher strike (OTM) call.\\n           ■   All options share the same expiration date for this strategy.\\n           ■   For this strategy, you must use both calls and puts. A Long Iron Butterfly is\\n               the combination of a Bull Put Spread and a Bear Call Spread.\\n           ■   The short put and the short call share the same middle (ATM) strike price.\\n           ■   Remember that there should be equal distance between each strike price,\\n               while the stock price should generally be as close as possible to the middle\\n               strike price.\\n           Steps In\\n           ■   Try to ensure that the trend is rangebound and identify clear areas of sup-\\n               port and resistance.\\n           Steps Out\\n           ■   Manage your position according to the rules defined in your Trading Plan.\\n           ■   Remember that the Long Iron Butterfly is a combination of other strategies,\\n               so it can be unraveled in two-leg chunks.\\n           ■   You can unravel the position just before expiration—remember to include\\n               all the commissions in your calculations.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 494,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 78,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/78.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"2.5.2 Context\\nOutlook\\n       ■  With Long Iron Butterflies, your outlook is direction neutral. You expect little\\n          movement in the stock price.\\nRationale\\n       ■  With Long Iron Butterflies, you are looking to execute a potentially high yield-\\n          ing trade at a net credit whereby your maximum profits occur where the stock\\n          finishes around the middle strike price at expiration.\\n       ■  You are anticipating low volatility with the stock price, which will lead you to\\n          profit.\\n       ■  If you examine what you’ve done here, you have simply combined a Bull Put\\n          Spread with a Bear Call Spread, both of which are net credit spreads. It can\\n          also be seen as a narrow Short Strangle, combined with a wider Long Strangle.\\nNet Position\\n       ■  This is a net credit trade.\\n       ■  Your maximum risk is the difference between any two strikes less your net\\n          credit.

A variation of the Long Iron Butterfly, it is in fact the combi-\\n        nation of a Bull Put Spread and a Bear Call Spread. The higher strike put is lower\\n        than the lower strike call in order to create the condor shape. The combination of\\n        two income strategies also makes this an income strategy. Traders often will leg into\\n        the Long Iron Condor, first trading a Bull Put Spread just below support and then\\n        as the stock rebounds off resistance adding a Bear Call Spread, thereby creating the\\n        Long Iron Condor.\\n           Ideally the stock will remain between the two middle strikes, with the maximum\\n        profit occurring if the options expire between these. In this ideal scenario, effective-\\n        ly all the options expire worthless, and you just keep the combined net credit. The\\n        combined net credit serves to widen the area of your breakevens—in other words,\\n        the Bull Put element helps the Bear Call element, and vice versa.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 498,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 82,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/82.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"Buy lower        Sell middle lower       Sell middle higher        Buy higher      Long Iron\\nstrike put       strike put              strike call               strike call     Condor\\nSteps to Trading a Long Iron Condor\\n        1.

In this way, we take in the additional income from the\\n        sold put; however, there is a significant price to pay in terms of risk.\\n            First, the sold put adds significant extra risk to the trade. The amount of poten-\\n        tial risk added is the put strike less the put premium received. Say if we trade a\\n        Covered Call on a $24.00 stock, taking in $1.00 for the call, our risk and breakeven\\n        is $23.00. If we sold a put for another $1.00, our initial yield on cash would be\\n        doubled . . . but our risk would have increased by another $24.00 ($25.00 \\u0002 $1.00),\\n        making our total risk $47.00 if the stock falls to zero. Although this is unlikely to\\n        occur in just one month, the position can become loss-making at approximately dou-\\n        ble the speed as a simple Covered Call position, so if the stock starts to fall, we’re in\\n        trouble much more quickly.\\n            Second, with a Covered Short Straddle, we are almost certain to be exercised\\n        because we have shorted both the put and the call at the same strike price. So unless\\n        the stock is at the strike price at expiration, we face a certain exercise, which many\\n        people are uncomfortable with. If the stock is above the strike at expiration, then\\n        we’re quite happy because our sold put expires worthless, our sold call is exercised,\\n        and we simply deliver the stock we already own. However, if the stock is below the\\n        strike at expiration, then our call expires worthless, our sold put is exercised, and we\\n        are required to purchase more stock at the strike price. With a falling stock, this can\\n        be pricey and undesirable.\\n            I’ve seen this taught as a viable strategy . . . don’t do it! There are better ways\\n        to enhance the income of a Covered Call, which we’ll go through later in this\\n        chapter!\\n        Buy stock                Sell put            Sell call             Covered Short Straddle\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 503,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 87,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/87.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"                                                                         Income Strategies       47\\nSteps to Trading a Covered Short Straddle\\n      1.

Sell calls with the same strike and expiration.\\n         ■   Generally, only sell the straddle element on a monthly basis. In this way\\n             you will capture more in premiums over several months, provided you are\\n             not exercised. Selling premium every month will net you more over a peri-\\n             od of time than selling premium a long way out. Remember that whenever\\n             you are selling options premium, time decay works in your favor. Time\\n             decay is at its fastest rate in the last 20 trading days (i.e., the last month), so\\n             when you sell option premiums, it is best to sell them with a month left,\\n             and do it again the following month.\\n         ■   Remember that your maximum gain is capped when the stock reaches the\\n             level of the (call) strike price.\\n         ■   You need to ensure that the strike price is below the level at which you\\n             think the stock will be at expiration; otherwise the sold put will be\\n             exercised, and you’ll have to buy more stock.\\n         ■   If trading U.S. stocks and options, you will be required to buy (or be long\\n             in) 100 shares for every options contract that you sell.\\n         Steps In\\n         ■   Preferably between $10.00 and $50.00. Above $50.00, it would be expensive.\\n         ■   Try to ensure that the trend is upward or rangebound and identify a clear\\n             area of support.\\n         Steps Out\\n         ■   Manage your position according to the rules defined in your Trading Plan.\\n         ■   If the stock closes above the strike at expiration, your call will be exercised.\\n             You will deliver the stock at the strike price, and you will have profited\\n             from both the option premiums you received and the uplift (if any) in stock\\n             price to reach the strike price. Exercise is automatic.\\n         ■   If the stock remains or falls below the strike, your put will be exercised,\\n             forcing you to buy more shares at the strike price. This could become\\n             expensive.\\n         ■   If the stock is resting at the strike price at expiration, then you’ll make a\\n             profit—but this is a highly risky strategy, and it’s unlikely that the stock\\n             will close precisely on the strike price anyway.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 504,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 88,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/88.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"2.7.2 Context\\nOutlook\\n       ■  With covered short straddles, your outlook is bullish. You expect a steady rise.\\nRationale\\n       ■  With covered short straddles, you are enhancing the yield of a covered call by\\n          introducing the sale of puts in addition to the calls you have sold against the\\n          stock you have bought. This has the effect of increasing your yield.\\n       ■  The hope is that if the stock rises, your sold puts will expire worthless, and\\n          you will keep the premium, whereas if your calls are exercised, you already\\n          own the stock to deliver. The biggest problem is if the stock plummets—your\\n          sold calls will expire worthless, enabling you to keep the premium, but you\\n          will be exercised on your sold puts, in which case you will have to buy more\\n          stock. Therefore, only use this strategy on stocks that you want to continue\\n          holding and adding to your position. This is a high-risk strategy.\\nNet Position\\n       ■  This is a net debit transaction because you are paying for the stock and are\\n          only taking in small premiums for the sold put and call options. You can\\n          increase your yield by purchasing the stock on margin, thereby doubling your\\n          yield if you use 50% margin—this is even more risky, however, if the stock falls\\n          below the strike price.\\n       ■  Your maximum risk is the price you pay for the stock, plus the (put) strike\\n          price, less the premiums you receive for the sold call and put. This is high-\\n          risk.\\nEffect of Time Decay\\n       ■  Time decay is helpful to your trade here because it should erode the value of\\n          the options you sold.\\nAppropriate Time Period to Trade\\n       ■  Sell the options on a monthly basis.\\nSelecting the Stock\\n       ■  Choose from stocks with adequate liquidity, preferably over 500,000 Average\\n          Daily Volume (ADV).\\n       ■  Preferably between $10.00 and $50.00.

The amount of potential risk\\n      added is the put strike less the put premium received. Say if we trade a Covered Call\\n      on a $24.00 stock, taking in $1.00 for the $25 strike call, our risk and breakeven is\\n      $23.00. If we sold a $22.50 strike put for another $1.00, our initial yield on cash would\\n      be doubled . . . but our risk would have increased by another $21.50 ($22.50 \\u0002 $1.00),\\n      making our total risk $44.50 if the stock falls to zero. Although this is unlikely to\\n      occur in just one month, the position can become loss-making at approximately dou-\\n      ble the speed as a simple Covered Call position, so if the stock starts to fall, we can\\n      be in trouble much more quickly.\\n          If the stock falls below the put strike at expiration, the call will expire worthless (so\\n      we keep the premium), the put will be exercised, and we’ll have to buy more stock at\\n      the put strike price. With a falling stock, this can be pricey and undesirable. If the stock\\n      is above the call strike at expiration, then we’re happy because our sold put expires\\n      worthless, our sold call is exercised, and we simply deliver the stock we already own.\\n          I’ve seen Wall Street traders use this strategy for their own devices without real-\\n      izing the downside risk to which they were exposing themselves. Although this is\\n      far preferable to the Covered Short Straddle, there are still better ways to enhance\\n      the income of a Covered Call, which we’ll go through later in this chapter.\\n      Buy stock             Sell OTM put            Sell OTM call           Covered Short Strangle\\nSteps to Trading a Covered Short Strangle\\n      1.

Sell OTM (higher strike) calls with the same expiration date.\\n           ■   Generally, only sell the strangle element on a monthly basis. In this way\\n               you will capture more in premiums over several months, provided you are\\n               not exercised. Selling premium every month will net you more over a peri-\\n               od of time than selling premium a long way out. Remember that whenever\\n               you are selling options premium, time decay works in your favor. Time\\n               decay is at its fastest rate in the last 20 trading days (i.e., the last month), so\\n               when you sell option premiums, it is best to sell it with a month left, and\\n               do it again the following month.\\n           ■   Remember that your maximum gain is capped when the stock reaches the\\n               level of the call’s strike price.\\n           ■   You need to ensure that the put strike price is OTM and below the level at\\n               which you think the stock will be at expiration; otherwise the sold put will\\n               be exercised, and you’ll have to buy more stock at the put strike price.\\n           ■   If trading U.S. stocks and options, you will be required to buy (or be long\\n               in) 100 shares for every options contract that you sell.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 509,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 93,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/93.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"                                                                        Income Strategies      53\\n         Steps In\\n         ■    Preferably between $10.00 and $50.00.

Exercise is automatic.\\n         ■    If the stock falls below the put strike, your put will be exercised, forcing you\\n              to buy more shares at the put strike price. This could become expensive.\\n         ■    If the stock is resting between the strike prices at expiration, then you’ll\\n              keep the premiums, but this is a dangerous strategy and is not recommend-\\n              ed because of the downside risk.\\n2.8.2 Context\\nOutlook\\n      ■   With covered short strangles, your outlook is bullish. You expect a steady rise.\\nRationale\\n      ■   With covered short strangles, you are enhancing the yield of a covered call by\\n          introducing the sale of OTM puts in addition to the calls you have sold against\\n          the stock you have bought. This has the effect of increasing your (monthly) yield.\\n      ■   The hope is that if the stock rises, your sold puts will expire worthless, and\\n          you will keep the premium, whereas if your calls are exercised, you already\\n          own the stock to deliver. The biggest problem is that if the stock plummets,\\n          your sold calls will expire worthless, enabling you to keep the premium, but\\n          you could be exercised on your sold puts, in which case you will have to buy\\n          more stock. Therefore, only use this strategy on stocks that you want to\\n          continue holding and adding to your position.\\nNet Position\\n      ■   With stocks, this is a net debit transaction because you are paying for the stock\\n          and only taking in small premiums for the sold put and call options. You can\\n          increase your yield by purchasing the stock on margin, thereby doubling your\\n          yield if you use 50% margin.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 510,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 94,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/94.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"       ■  Your maximum risk is the price you pay for the stock, plus the put strike price,\\n          less the premiums you receive for the sold call and put.

This has the effect of radically reducing the investment, thereby\\n        increasing the initial yield. However, this initial yield is not necessarily reflective of\\n        the maximum yield at the expiration of the short-term short call. The maximum yield\\n        will depend on both the stock price and the residual value of the long unexpired call.\\n            The problem with a Calendar Call is in the very essence of the shape of the risk\\n        profile (see the following). What we’d like to do is create something similar to a\\n        Covered Call, but with a better yield and without the expense. The Calendar Call\\n        certainly requires less investment; however, the shape is different. If the stock rises\\n        too far too soon, then the Calendar Call can become loss-making. So even though\\n        you got the direction of the trade right, you could still lose money! This happens\\n        because the long call, being near the money, only moves at around half the speed as\\n        the underlying stock as the stock price rises. This means that in the event of exercise,\\n        if the stock has risen by, say, $10.00 from $30.00, and your option has only risen by\\n        $5.00, you may be exercised on the short call; therefore you buy the stock at $40.00\\n        and sell it at $30.00 (if that was the strike), yet your long call has only risen by $5.00,\\n        giving you a $5.00 loss. If you only received $2.00 for the short call, you’re looking\\n        at a $3.00 loss on the trade.\\n            Both options share the same strike, so if the stock rises above the strike, your\\n        short call will be exercised. You’ll then have to sell the long call (hopefully for a\\n        profit), use the proceeds to buy the stock at the market price, and then sell it back at\\n        the strike price. Therefore, the best thing that can happen is that the stock is at the\\n        strike price at the first expiration. This will enable you to write another call for the\\n        following month if you like.\\n        Buy call                                Sell call                          Calendar Call\\nSteps to Trading a Calendar Call\\n        1. Buy a long-term expiration call with a near the money strike price.\\n        2.

This has the\\n        effect of reducing the investment, thereby increasing the initial yield. As with the\\n        Calendar Call, this initial yield is not necessarily reflective of the maximum yield at\\n        the expiration of the short-term short call. The maximum yield will depend on both\\n        the stock price and the residual value of the long unexpired call.\\n           The Diagonal Call solves the problems experienced with the Calendar Call, in\\n        that the shape of the risk profile (see the following) is more akin to the Covered Call,\\n        which is what we want. Yet the Diagonal Call is going to be a far cheaper invest-\\n        ment! If the stock rises explosively, then unlike the Calendar Call, the Diagonal Call\\n        done correctly won’t become loss-making. The key is not to get too greedy!\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 520,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 104,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/104.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"         Let’s say we’re looking to do a Diagonal Call on a $25.00 stock. The two-year\\n      $20.00 call is say, $7.50, and we sell next month’s $27.50 call for $0.75, giving us an\\n      initial cash yield of 10%. If the share rises to $40.00, within the next month, our long\\n      call will be worth at least $22.00 ($20.00 intrinsic value alone!). We’ll have to buy the\\n      stock for $40.00 and sell it at $20.00 (making a $20.00 loss), but we’ll retain the $0.75\\n      from the selling the short-term OTM option. Total position is still profitable by\\n      around $2.75.\\n         At the end of this section, we’ll go through a real example, but the main point is\\n      this: Because we’re buying deep ITM calls, the long option will have a higher delta and\\n      will move more in step (dollar for dollar) with the stock as it rises. This means that the\\n      stock rising explosively won’t damage our position, unlike with the Calendar Call.\\n         The bought option is long-term and deep ITM, and the short option is short-term\\n      and OTM. If the stock rises above the higher (short) strike, your short call will be\\n      exercised. You’ll then have to sell the long call (for a profit), use the proceeds to\\n      buy the stock at the market price, and then sell it back at the strike price. The maxi-\\n      mum profit occurs where the stock is at the short call (higher) strike price at the first\\n      expiration.\\n      Buy call                               Sell call                             Diagonal Call\\nSteps to Trading a Diagonal Call\\n      1. Buy a deep ITM (lower strike) long-term expiration call.\\n      2. Sell a higher strike short-term call (say monthly).\\n          Steps In\\n           ■   Try to ensure that the trend is upward or rangebound and identify a clear\\n               area of support.\\n          Steps Out\\n           ■   Manage your position according to the rules defined in your Trading Plan.\\n           ■   If the stock closes above the higher strike at expiration, you will be exer-\\n               cised. You will sell your long call, buy the stock at the market price, and\\n               deliver it at the higher strike price, having profited from both the option\\n               premium you received and the uplift in the long option premium. Exercise\\n               of the short option is automatic. Do not exercise the long option or you will\\n               forfeit its time value.\\n           ■   If the stock remains below the higher strike but above your stop loss, let\\n               the short call expire worthless and keep the entire premium. If you like,\\n               you can then write another call for the following month.\\n           ■   If the stock falls below your stop loss, then either sell the long option (if\\n               you’re approved for Naked Call writing) or reverse the entire position.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 521,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 105,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/105.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"                                                                        Income Strategies   65\\n2.10.2 Context\\nOutlook\\n       ■  With a Diagonal Call, your outlook is bullish.\\nRationale\\n       ■  To generate income against your longer term long position by selling calls and\\n          receiving the premium.\\nNet Position\\n       ■  This is a net debit transaction because your bought calls will be more expen-\\n          sive than your sold calls, which are OTM and have less time value.\\n       ■  Your maximum risk on the trade itself is limited to the net debit of the bought\\n          calls less the sold calls. Your maximum reward occurs when the stock price is\\n          at the sold call (higher) strike price at the expiration of the sold call.\\nEffect of Time Decay\\n       ■  Time decay affects your Diagonal Call trade in a mixed fashion.

The question lies in whether you can achieve a better yield\\n      using the puts versus the calls.\\n         Like the Calendar Call, the problem with a Calendar Put is in the very essence of\\n      the shape of the risk profile (see the following). What we’d like to do is create some-\\n      thing similar to a Covered Call, but with a better yield and without the expense.\\n      The Calendar Put certainly requires less investment; however, the shape is differ-\\n      ent. If the stock rises too far too soon, then the Calendar Put can become loss-\\n      making. So even though you got the direction of the trade right, you could still lose\\n      money!\\n         Both options share the same strike, so if the stock rises above the strike, your short\\n      put will expire worthless, whereas your long put will be less valuable because it’s\\n      now further OTM. If the stock falls, the short put will be exercised, and you’ll then\\n      have to sell the long put (hopefully for a profit), use the proceeds to sell the stock at\\n      the market price, and then buy it back at the strike price. Therefore, the best thing\\n      that can happen is that the stock is at the strike price at the first expiration. This will\\n      enable you to write another put for the following month if you like.\\n      Buy put                                Sell put                               Calendar Put\\nSteps to Trading a Calendar Put\\n      1. Buy a long-term expiration put with a near the money strike price.\\n      2. Sell a short-term put (say monthly) with the same strike price.\\n          Steps In\\n          ■   Try to ensure that the trend is upward or rangebound and identify clear\\n              areas of support and resistance.\\n          Steps Out\\n          ■   Manage your position according to the rules defined in your Trading Plan.\\n          ■   If the stock closes below the strike at expiration, you will be exercised. You\\n              will sell your long put, buy the stock at the strike price, and sell it at the\\n              market price, having profited from both the short option premium you\\n              received and the uplift in the long option premium. Exercise of the short\\n              option is automatic. Do not exercise the long option or you will forfeit its\\n              time value.\\n          ■   If the stock rises above the strike but above your lower stop loss, let the\\n              short put expire worthless and keep the entire premium. You can then write\\n              another put for the following month.\\n          ■   If the stock rises above your higher stop loss, then either sell the long option\\n              (if you’re approved for Naked Put writing) or reverse the entire position.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 527,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 111,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/111.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"                                                                         Income Strategies         71\\n2.11.2 Context\\nOutlook\\n       ■  With a Calendar Put, your outlook is neutral to bullish.

Your maximum reward is limited to the residual put\\n          value when the stock is at the strike price at the first expiration, less the net debit.\\nEffect of Time Decay\\n       ■  Time decay affects your Calendar Put trade in a mixed fashion.

Look for over six months for the long option.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 528,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 112,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/112.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"2.11.3 Risk Profile\\n          ■   Maximum Risk           [Put strike] – [maximum value of long put at the first\\n                                     expiration] \\u0001 [net debit]\\n          ■   Maximum Reward         [Long put value at strike price at first expiration] \\u0002\\n                                     [net debit]\\n          ■   Breakeven Down         Depends on the value of the long put option at the time\\n                                     of the short put expiration\\n          ■   Breakeven Up           Depends on the value of the long put option at the time\\n                                     of the short put expiration\\n2.11.4 Greeks\\n                        Key:\\n                        Expiration\\n                        Today – 1 month\\n                        Time(t) – 5 days\\n                                                                                 Theta\\nRisk Profile\\n                                        Risk Profile                    Theta    Theta is positive,\\nMaximum profit is\\n                                                                                 illustrating that time\\nachieved when the\\n                                                                                 decay is helpful to\\nstock is at the strike\\n                                                                                 the position around\\nprice at the time of\\n                                                                                 the strike price,\\nthe short put expira-\\n                                                                                 where the position is\\ntion date.

Ultimately the strategy is virtually identical. The question lies in whether you\\n        can achieve a better yield using the puts versus the calls.\\n           The Diagonal Put solves the problems experienced with the Calendar Put, in that\\n        the shape of the risk profile (see the following) is more akin to the Covered Call,\\n        which is what we want. Yet the Diagonal Put is going to be a far cheaper investment,\\n        particularly because the long put element is OTM! If the stock rises explosively, then\\n        unlike the Calendar Put, the Diagonal Put done correctly won’t become loss-making.\\n        The key is not to get too greedy!\\n           The bought option is long-term and OTM, and the short option is short-term and\\n        ITM. If the stock rises above the higher (short) strike, your short put will expire\\n        worthless, and the long put will decrease in value. The long put will reduce in value\\n        because it is further OTM and there will have been some time decay, too.\\n        Buy put                               Sell put                              Diagonal Put\\nSteps to Trading a Diagonal Put\\n        1. Buy a lower strike long-term expiration put.\\n        2.

This of course can depend on the strikes\\n          that you choose and the different expiration dates that you choose (i.e., you can\\n          create a net debit if your long put is far enough away from expiration, your\\n          short put has a very short time to expiration, and the strike prices are quite\\n          close together).\\nEffect of Time Decay\\n       ■  Time decay affects your Diagonal Put trade in a mixed fashion. It erodes the\\n          value of the long put but can help you with your income strategy by eroding\\n          the value faster on the short put, depending on how far ITM it is.\\nAppropriate Time Period to Trade\\n       ■  You will be safest to choose a long time to expiration with the long put and a\\n          shorter time for the short put.\\nSelecting the Stock\\n       ■  Choose from stocks with adequate liquidity, preferably over 500,000 Average\\n          Daily Volume (ADV).\\n       ■  Try to ensure that the trend is upward or rangebound and identify a clear area\\n          of support.\\nSelecting the Option\\n       ■  Choose options with adequate liquidity; open interest should be at least 100,\\n          preferably 500.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 534,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 118,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/118.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"          ■   Lower Strike—Look for a deep OTM (ideally around 10\\u000220% lower) strike\\n              below the current stock price.\\n          ■   Higher Strike—Look for ITM (higher) by more than one strike to raise enough\\n              income on the trade.\\n          ■   Expirations—Look at either of the next two expirations for the short option\\n              and compare monthly yields.

Whereas the Covered Call is bullish, the Covered Put is a bearish\\n      income strategy, where you receive a substantial net credit for shorting both the put\\n      and the stock simultaneously to create the spread.\\n         The concept is that in shorting the stock, you then sell an Out of the Money put\\n      option on a monthly basis as a means of collecting rent (or a dividend) while you are\\n      short the stock.\\n         The trade-off is that an OTM Covered Put will give a higher potential yield but\\n      less cushion, whereas an ITM Covered Put will give a lower yield but much more\\n      cushion. This is not a recommended strategy (partly because it’s a little confusing!),\\n      but “you pays your money, you takes your chances” on this one!\\n         If the stock falls below the put strike, you’ll be exercised and will have to buy the\\n      stock at the strike price . . . but you make a profit because you’ve already shorted it,\\n      so the purchase simply closes your stock position, and you retain the premium for\\n      the sold put. (You’re covered because you shorted the stock in the first place.) If the\\n      stock remains static, then you simply collect the put premium. If the stock rises, you\\n      have the cushion of the put premium you collected.\\n      Short stock                              Sell OTM put                            Covered Put\\nSteps to Trading a Covered Put\\n      1. Short sell the stock.\\n      2. Sell puts one strike price out of the money [OTM] (i.e., puts with a strike price\\n          lower than the stock).\\n          ■    If the stock is purchased simultaneously with writing the call contract, the\\n               strategy is commonly referred to as a “buy-write.”\\n          ■    Generally, only sell the puts on a monthly basis. In this way you will cap-\\n               ture more in premiums over several months, provided you are not exer-\\n               cised. Selling premium every month will net you more over a period of\\n               time than selling premium a long way out. Remember that whenever you\\n               are selling options premium, time decay works in your favor. Time decay is\\n               at its fastest rate in the last 20 trading days (i.e., the last month), so when\\n               you sell option premiums, it is best to sell it with a month left, and do it\\n               again the following month.\\n          ■    Remember that your maximum gain is capped when the stock falls to the\\n               level of the put strike price.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 540,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 124,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/124.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"         ■    If trading U.S. stocks and options, you will be required to sell (or be short\\n              in) 100 shares for every put contract that you sell.\\n         Steps In\\n         ■    Try to ensure that the trend is downward or rangebound and identify a\\n              clear area of resistance.\\n         Steps Out\\n         ■    Manage your position according to the rules defined in your Trading Plan.\\n         ■    If the stock closes below the strike at expiration, you will be exercised.

A net debit spread is where you pay a net debit for the trade, thereby mak-\\n     ing you net long in options. Because you are net long in options, you’re better off\\n     giving yourself plenty of time in terms of the expiration date you choose so that\\n     you’re not hurt too much by time decay.\\n        A net credit spread is where you receive a net credit for the trade, thereby mak-\\n     ing you net short in options. Because you’re net short in options, you’re better off\\n     doing a short-term trade in terms of the expiration date and allowing time decay to\\n     do its work for you.\\n        We’ve actually already covered two vertical spread strategies in Chapter 2,\\n     “Income Strategies”—the Bull Put and Bear Call spreads.

So, there\\n     are a total of four vertical spread strategies plus four Ladder strategies.\\n        The ladders are not popular strategies, and they can be a little confusing, so by all\\n     means skip those sections if you’re purely looking for the most practical strategies\\n     to use.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 546,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 130,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/130.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"3.1 Bull Call Spread\\nProficiency      Direction    Volatility Asset Legs      Max Risk    Max Reward     Strategy Type\\n                              N/A             \\u0001             !\\nIntermediate     Bullish                 ■ Long Call     Capped      Capped         Capital Gain\\n                                         ■ Short Call\\n3.1.1 Description\\n        The Bull Call is a vertical spread strategy that creates a net debit in your account. You\\n        buy a near the money long-term (typically over six months to expiration) call and sell\\n        a higher strike (typically OTM) call with the same expiration.\\n           The net effect of the strategy is to bring down the cost and breakeven on the trade\\n        compared to simply buying the long call. The bought leg is closer to the money than\\n        the sold leg, so it is more expensive and also has a higher Delta than the OTM sold\\n        call leg. Therefore you don’t want to be over-exposed to time decay, which is at its\\n        most profound in the last month. When you add the fact that your stock must move\\n        upwards in order for you to reach your breakeven point, bull calls tend to be more\\n        suited to longer-term trades where you need time to be right.\\n           The Bull Call Spread requires a bullish outlook because you will make a profit\\n        only when the stock price rises. However, the returns possible on this strategy can be\\n        spectacular if you get it right and everything goes in your favor. The bought leg gives\\n        you the leverage, but the sold leg reduces your cost and increases your leverage,\\n        though at the expense of capping your upside.\\n           Many so-called options instructors advocate the Bull Call Spread because it’s easy\\n        to show spectacular potential returns. The key word here is potential. It’s all very well\\n        demonstrating a trade where you can make 400% more than your initial stake, but if\\n        the stock has to rise by 50% for us to get there, then I’m more likely to look at the\\n        odds of that happening, rather than being suckered in by the attractive potential yield.\\n        Personally, when I do these, I always look first at where my breakeven point is. If it’s\\n        not too far away, then I’ll see if the yield is attractive enough.\\n           So, in summary, if the stock falls below the lower (bought) strike, you make your\\n        maximum loss; if the stock rises to the higher (sold) strike, you make your maximum\\n        profit. In between these points, your breakeven point lies at the lower strike plus the\\n        net debit.\\n        Buy lower strike call                    Sell OTM call                     Bull Call Spread\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 547,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 131,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/131.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"                                                                         Vertical Spreads     91\\nSteps to Trading a Bull Call Spread\\n      1.

You\\n      buy a near the money long-term (typically over six months to expiration) put and\\n      sell a lower strike (typically OTM) put with the same expiration.\\n         The net effect of the strategy is to bring down the cost and raise the breakeven\\n      on the trade compared to simply buying the long put. The bought leg is closer to\\n      the money than the sold leg, so it is more expensive. Therefore, you don’t want to\\n      be over-exposed to time decay, which is at its most profound in the last month.\\n      When you add the fact that your stock must move downwards in order for you to\\n      reach your breakeven point, Bear Puts tend to be more suited to longer-term trades\\n      where you need time to be right.\\n         The Bear Put Spread requires a bearish outlook because you will make a profit\\n      only when the stock price falls. However, the possible returns on this strategy can be\\n      spectacular if you get it right and everything goes in your favor. The bought leg\\n      gives you the leverage, but the sold leg reduces your cost and increases your lever-\\n      age, though at the expense of capping your upside.\\n         The Bear Put Spread appears attractive because it can show spectacular potential\\n      returns. Again, the key word here is potential. It’s all very well demonstrating a trade\\n      where you can make 400% more than your initial stake, but if the stock must fall by\\n      50% for us to get there, then I’m more likely to look at the odds of that happening,\\n      rather than being suckered in by the attractive potential yield.\\n         So, in summary, if the stock rises above the higher (bought) strike, you make your\\n      maximum loss; if the stock falls to the lower (sold) strike, you make your maximum\\n      profit. In between these points, your breakeven point lies at the higher strike less the\\n      net debit.\\n      Sell lower strike put                   Buy OTM put                       Bear Put Spread\\nSteps to Trading a Bear Put Spread\\n      1.

We’d love the stock\\n      to rise to the middle strike price (the first Short Call) but not above the higher short\\n      call strike price. Anywhere in between the middle and higher strike is ideal.\\n          Because of the dangers of uncapped risk, this strategy becomes more appropriate\\n      for a short-term income trade. The net effect of the higher short strike is to reduce\\n      the cost and breakeven of the Bull Call Spread and adjust the directional nature of\\n      the trade. The higher call strike prices are further OTM and will therefore have\\n      lower premiums than the lower strike bought call.\\n          So, in summary, if the stock falls below the lower (buy) strike, you can make a loss;\\n      if the stock rises to anywhere between the middle and upper (short) strikes, you make\\n      your maximum profit; if the stock rises above the highest strike, then you can make\\n      unlimited losses.

Although this strategy has an uncapped risk potential as the\\n           underlying asset rises significantly, with Bull Call Ladders, your outlook is\\n           dependent on the relationship between the stock price and the first strike\\n           price. If we look at the strategy as an extension of a Bull Call Spread, then our\\n           outlook becomes conservatively bullish. However, for our purposes, we’re\\n           going to call this a direction-neutral strategy.\\nRationale\\n      ■    To execute a direction neutral/conservatively bullish trade for enhanced\\n           income.

Here we have a “Bull Put Ladder,”\\n        yet looking at it suggests that it has to be a bearish strategy!\\n            The Bull Put Ladder is an extension to the Bull Put Spread. By buying another\\n        put at a lower strike, the position assumes uncapped reward potential if the stock\\n        plummets.\\n            The problem is that now it’s not totally clear if we have a bullish or bearish strat-\\n        egy, but because we are net long puts and we have uncapped profit potential if the\\n        stock falls, do we have to call this a bearish strategy? The answer lies in the reason\\n        for the trade and the position of the stock relative to the strikes.\\n            Because we’re net long options (and particularly OTM options), we’re better off\\n        trading this as a longer-term strategy in order to counter the effects of time decay.\\n            So, in summary, if the stock falls below the lower (buy) strike, we make poten-\\n        tially uncapped profit until the stock reaches zero; if the stock rises to anywhere\\n        between the middle and upper (short) strikes, we make our maximum loss. The\\n        extra leg also ensures that we may have two breakeven points.\\n        Buy put                   Buy put                 Sell put                Bull Put Ladder\\nSteps to Trading a Bull Put Ladder\\n        1. Buy lower strike puts.\\n        2. Buy the same number of middle strike puts with the same expiration date.\\n        3. Sell the same number of higher strike puts with same expiration date.\\n             Steps In\\n             ■   Try to ensure you understand the direction of the trend and identify a clear\\n                 area of both support and resistance.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 561,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 145,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/145.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"                                                                         Vertical Spreads     105\\n          Steps Out\\n          ■   Manage your position according to the rules defined in your Trading Plan.\\n          ■   In any event, look to unravel the position at least one month before expira-\\n              tion, either to capture your profit or to contain your losses.\\n3.6.2 Context\\nOutlook\\n       ■  A Bull Put Ladder is a Bull Put Spread with an additional lower bought put\\n          further OTM. Although this strategy has an uncapped reward as the underly-\\n          ing asset declines significantly, with Bull Put Ladders, your outlook is depend-\\n          ent on the relationship between the stock price and the higher strike price.\\n          Because we are buying an additional put leg, we can categorize our outlook\\n          here as being bearish. Typically a Bull Put Ladder arises when a Bull Put\\n          Spread has gone wrong and the trader adjusts the position to become bearish.\\nRationale\\n       ■  To execute a bearish trade for a capital gain. The lower strike bought puts will\\n          have the effect of uncapping your profit potential; the higher strike sold puts\\n          will reduce the cost basis.\\nNet Position\\n       ■  This can be a net debit or net credit transaction because while your sold puts\\n          will be more valuable than your bought puts, you’re buying more puts that\\n          you’re selling.\\n       ■  Your maximum reward on the trade is uncapped because you are buying more\\n          puts than you’re selling. Your total risk on the trade is limited to the difference\\n          between the lower and middle strike prices less your interim risk.\\nEffect of Time Decay\\n       ■  Time decay is generally harmful when the position is losing money, particular-\\n          ly around the middle strike.\\nAppropriate Time Period to Trade\\n       ■  Depending on the reasons for the trade, you will be safest to choose a medium\\n          to long term to expiration, enough time to allow the underlying asset to move\\n          and make the position profitable without time decay destroying the long\\n          options.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 562,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 146,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/146.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"Selecting the Stock\\n      ■  Choose from stocks with adequate liquidity, preferably over 500,000 Average\\n         Daily Volume (ADV).\\n      ■  Try to ensure you understand the direction of the trend and identify a clear\\n         area of both support and resistance.\\nSelecting the Options\\n      ■  Choose options with adequate liquidity; open interest should be at least 100,\\n         preferably 500.\\n      ■  The selection of your option legs really depends on whether you’re using the\\n         strategy as a repair to the Bull Put Spread or as a Bull Put Ladder in its own\\n         right.

Here we have a “Bear Call\\n        Ladder,” yet looking at it would suggest that it has to be a bullish strategy!\\n            The Bear Call Ladder is an extension to the Bear Call Spread. By buying another\\n        call at a higher strike, the position assumes uncapped reward potential if the stock\\n        soars.\\n            The problem is that now it’s not totally clear if we have a bullish or bearish strat-\\n        egy, but because we are net long calls and we have uncapped profit potential if the\\n        stock rises, do we have to call this a bearish strategy? The answer lies in the reason\\n        for the trade and the position of the stock relative to the strikes.\\n            Because we’re net long options (and particularly OTM options), we’re better off\\n        trading this as a longer-term strategy in order to counter the effects of time decay.\\n            So, in summary, if the stock rises above the higher (buy) strike, we make poten-\\n        tially uncapped profit; if the stock falls to anywhere between the middle and lower\\n        strikes, we make our maximum loss. The extra leg also ensures that we may have\\n        two breakeven points.\\n        Sell call                  Buy call              Buy call                Bear Call Ladder\\nSteps to Trading a Bear Call Ladder\\n        1. Sell lower strike calls.\\n        2. Buy the same number of middle strike calls with the same expiration date.\\n        3. Buy the same number of higher strike calls with same expiration date.\\n             Steps In\\n             ■    The selection of your option legs really depends on whether you’re using\\n                  the strategy as a repair to the Bear Call Spread or as a Bear Call Ladder in\\n                  its own right.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 566,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 150,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/150.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"          ■   Try to ensure that you understand the direction of the trend and identify a\\n              clear area of both support and resistance\\n          Steps Out\\n          ■   Manage your position according to the rules defined in your Trading Plan.\\n          ■   In any event, look to unravel the position at least one month before expira-\\n              tion, either to capture your profit or to contain your losses.\\n3.7.2 Context\\nOutlook\\n       ■  A Bear Call Ladder is a Bear Call Spread with an additional bought call leg\\n          further OTM. Although this strategy has an uncapped reward profile as the\\n          underlying asset rises significantly, with Bear Call Ladders, your outlook is\\n          dependent on the relationship between the stock price and the lower strike\\n          price. Because we are buying an additional call leg, we can categorize our out-\\n          look here as being bullish. Typically a Bear Call Ladder arises when a Bear\\n          Call Spread has gone wrong and the trader adjusts the position to become\\n          bullish.\\nRationale\\n       ■  To execute a bullish trade for a capital gain while reducing your maximum\\n          risk. The higher strike bought calls will have the effect of uncapping your\\n          upside potential.\\nNet Position\\n       ■  This can be a net debit or net credit trade because while your sold call will be\\n          more valuable than your bought calls, you’re buying more calls than you’re\\n          selling.\\n       ■  Your maximum risk on the trade is capped because you are buying more calls\\n          than you’re selling. Your maximum reward on the trade is unlimited to the\\n          upside.\\nEffect of Time Decay\\n       ■  Time decay is generally harmful when the position is losing money and\\n          helpful when the position is profitable.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 567,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 151,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/151.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"                                                                       Vertical Spreads   111\\nAppropriate Time Period to Trade\\n      ■  Depending on the reasons for the trade, it’s safest to choose a medium to long\\n         term to expiration, enough time to allow the underlying asset to move and\\n         make the position profitable without time decay destroying the long options.\\nSelecting the Stock\\n      ■  Choose from stocks with adequate liquidity, preferably over 500,000 Average\\n         Daily Volume (ADV).\\n      ■  Try to ensure you understand the direction of the trend and identify a clear\\n         area of both support and resistance\\nSelecting the Options\\n      ■  Choose options with adequate liquidity; open interest should be at least 100,\\n         preferably 500.\\n      ■  The selection of your option legs really depends on whether you’re using the\\n         strategy as a repair to the Bear Call Spread or as a Bear Call Ladder in its own\\n         right. You really need to use online tools to evaluate the optimum trade in\\n         your chosen context, but here we’ll assume the intent is to repair the Bear Call\\n         Spread.\\n      ■  Lower Strike—Slightly OTM, just above resistance for the stock.\\n      ■  Middle Strike—One or two strikes above the lower strike, i.e., further OTM.\\n      ■  Higher Strike—Above the middle strike, i.e., even further OTM.\\n      ■  Expiration—Typically, a Bear Call Spread is a short-term income strategy, so if\\n         you’re adding the lowest buy leg to repair the original Bear Call, then by defi-\\n         nition it will have been short-term (one month) trade.

By shorting another put\\n        at a lower strike price, the position assumes uncapped risk potential if the stock\\n        plummets downwards. Again, the problem is that now it’s not totally clear if we\\n        have a bullish or bearish strategy, so we have to designate it as a direction neutral\\n        strategy! We’d love the stock to fall to the middle strike price but not below the lower\\n        short put strike price. Anywhere in between the middle and higher strike is ideal.\\n           Because of the dangers of uncapped risk, this strategy becomes more appropriate\\n        for a short-term income trade. The net effect of the lower short strike is to reduce the\\n        cost and breakeven of the Bear Put Spread and adjust the directional nature of the\\n        trade. The lower put strike prices are further OTM and will therefore have lower\\n        premiums than the higher strike bought put.\\n           So, in summary, if the stock rises above the higher (buy) strike, you can make a\\n        loss; if the stock falls to anywhere between the middle and lower (short) strikes, you\\n        make your maximum profit; if the stock falls below the lowest strike, then you can\\n        make unlimited losses. The extra leg also ensures that you may have two breakeven\\n        points.\\n        Sell put                   Sell put              Buy put                  Bear Put Ladder\\nSteps to Trading a Bear Put Ladder\\n        1.

Although this strategy has an uncapped risk potential if the\\n          underlying asset falls significantly, with Bear Put Ladders, your outlook is\\n          dependent on the relationship between the stock price and the higher strike\\n          price. If we look at the strategy as an extension of a Bear Put Spread, then our\\n          outlook becomes conservatively bearish. However, for our purposes we’re\\n          going to call this a direction neutral strategy.\\nRationale\\n       ■  To execute a direction neutral/conservatively bearish trade for enhanced\\n          income. The lower strike sold puts will have the effect of uncapping your\\n          potential risk.\\nNet Position\\n       ■  This can be a net debit or net credit trade because while your bought puts will\\n          be more expensive than your sold puts, you’re selling more puts that you’re\\n          buying. Most of the time this is likely to be a net debit trade.\\n       ■  Your maximum risk on the trade is uncapped to the downside because you are\\n          selling more puts than you’re buying. Your maximum reward on the trade is\\n          limited to the difference between the middle and higher strike prices less your\\n          net debit or plus your net credit.\\nEffect of Time Decay\\n       ■  Time decay is generally helpful when the position is profitable, particularly\\n          around the middle strike.\\nAppropriate Time Period to Trade\\n       ■  You will be safest to choose a shorter term to expiration in order to avoid the\\n          possibility of an uncapped loss scenario if the underlying asset falls too much.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 572,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 156,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/156.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"Selecting the Stock\\n      ■  Choose from stocks with adequate liquidity, preferably over 500,000 Average\\n         Daily Volume (ADV).\\n      ■  Try to ensure that the trend is downward but identify a clear area of support\\n         and resistance.\\nSelecting the Options\\n      ■  Choose options with adequate liquidity; open interest should be at least 100,\\n         preferably 500.\\n      ■  The selection of your option legs really depends on whether you’re using the\\n         strategy as a repair to the Bear Put Spread or as a Bear Put Ladder in its own\\n         right.

The point is that you don’t care which direction it moves,\\n     as long as it moves explosively in one direction or the other. The trick, of course, is\\n     spotting something that’s about to make that move and then determining how to\\n     take advantage of it!\\n         In my workshops, I always ask my delegates who’s ever taken a stock tip before.\\n     Typically a number of sheepish faces look around the room at each other before the\\n     hands start to rise, and them I usher them all upwards! So, how about you? Have\\n     you ever taken a red-hot stock tip? I bet you have . . . or will some time in the\\n     future!\\n         So, if you took a tip, what happened? Did you win, or did you lose? Here’s where\\n     most people admit that most of the tips went the wrong way. Very rarely does noth-\\n     ing happen—occasionally it goes your way, but in many cases, the precise opposite\\n     happens, time and time again!\\n         The reality is that, as human beings, most of us will listen to a persuasive voice\\n     whose owner appears convinced as to the authenticity of the information he or she\\n     is now imparting to you. I tell most people that when evaluating a company, the last\\n     person you should ever listen to is the CEO, with the exception of the incompara-\\n     ble Warren Buffett! Typically, CEOs are rewarded on the strength of the perform-\\n     ance of their companies in terms of profitability and share price. Has a CEO ever\\n     confided in you that his company is junk and you should run away from it? Of\\n     course not! So it’s unlikely that you’re going to get an objective analysis from a\\n     CEO.\\n         So the question is this—what do we do if we get a stock tip and we’re tempted\\n     to follow it? Well, I’m not so aloof as to completely look the other way, so I’m not\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 576,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 160,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/160.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"going to preach that you should either! Instead, here’s what to do. Typically a stock\\ntip is a precursor to a big move in a stock. The rumors are flying around, and there’s\\npent-up activity in the trading of the stock. The only things you don’t know are the\\ntiming of such a move and the direction it’s going to turn. Typically the incident\\nwon’t be too far away, especially if the tip is concerning an announcement or news\\nevent. From here, one of three things is most likely to happen:\\n1. The news event happens as you were told it would, and the stock moves\\n     accordingly.\\n2. The news event happens in precisely the opposite way, and the stock accord-\\n     ingly explodes the other way!\\n3. The news event doesn’t happen . . . and the stock moves the opposite way.\\nOccasionally the stock won’t budge, but it’s pretty rare. Why? Well, because people\\nwere expecting at least something to happen, and when nothing happens, there’s\\neither mass disappointment or mass relief. The point is that there will be a reaction\\nto nothing, just as much as there would have been a reaction to something!\\n   There are two great strategies for handling stock tips. The first is the Straddle,\\nwhich we’re going to cover in this section, and the second is the Synthetic Call,\\nwhich we’re going to cover in Chapter 7, “Synthetic Strategies.” The Straddle\\ninvolves buying and selling calls and puts with the same strike and expiration,\\nwhich ensures that you can profit either way, provided that the stock moves explo-\\nsively; the Synthetic Call ensures that you’re insured if the stock falls, counter to\\nyour bullish expectations.\\n   The Straddle can be made less expensive by adjusting the call and put strikes\\nout of the money to create a Strangle. Because strangles are cheaper and your cost\\nbasis is lower, you stand to make bigger percentage returns if the stock moves\\nexplosively.\\n   The other strategies in this section are “nice-to-haves,” but they rarely form part\\nof my trading arsenal, so don’t worry unduly about them.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 577,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 161,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/161.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"                                                                                  Volatility Strategies     121\\nVolatility Strategies Staircase\\n        This diagram shows how the various volatility strategies link together, highlighting\\n        their similarities and differences.

The prob-\\nlem with buying options includes time decay and the Bid/Ask Spread. Time decay\\nhurts long options positions because options are like wasting assets. The closer we\\nget to expiration, the less time value there is in the option. Time decay accelerates\\nexponentially during the last month before expiration, so we don’t want to hold\\nonto OTM or ATM options into the last month. We also do not want to be buying\\nand selling the same Straddle too frequently because typically the Bid/Ask Spread\\nis quite wide, and if we continually buy at the Ask and sell at the Bid when the stock\\nhasn’t moved for us, then the spread will cause us to lose.\\n    So we must have a number of reasons for getting in, staying in, and then getting\\nout. We also need to know that the price that we’re paying for the Straddle is rea-\\nsonable in comparison to the propensity the stock has to making a significant move.\\nIn other words, the cheaper the cost of the Straddle, the better, provided that the\\nstock is one that can and will move explosively.\\n    Here are the rules for trading straddles:\\n1. My personal preference is to choose stocks over $20.00, preferably no more\\n     than $60.00. That’s not to say that you can’t make profits from stocks outside\\n     of that range; it’s simply my own comfort zone.\\n2. Only do a Straddle on a stock that is close to making an announcement, such\\n     as the week before an earnings report.\\n3. Buy ATM calls and puts with the expiration at least two months away, preferably\\n     three. You can get away with four months if nothing else is available.\\n4. The cost of the Straddle should be less than half of the stock’s recent high less\\n     its recent low. By recent, we mean the last 40 trading days for a two-month\\n     straddle, the last 60 trading days for a three-month straddle, or the last 80 days\\n     for a four-month straddle. The point here is that the cost of the Straddle should\\n     be low in comparison with the potential of the stock to move.\\n5. Exit within two weeks after the news event occurs. Try to avoid holding the\\n     position during the final month before expiration. In the final month, options\\n     suffer from accelerating time decay, which would therefore erode our position.\\n6. Try to find a stock that is forming a consolidation pattern, such as a flag or\\n     pennant, or in other words, where the stock price action has become tighter and\\n     where volatility has shrunk in advance of a big move in either direction. You\\n     should familiarize yourself with the basics of technical analysis at the very least.\\nIt’s important to follow the entry and exit rules for straddles, and psychologically\\nspeaking, the Straddle is a tough strategy to play after you’re in. It’s very easy to\\nfind reasons to exit, even though it’s in breach of your trading plan.

In other words, the stock would have to fall to below $20.90 or\\n      rise above $29.10 in order for us to make a profit. In reality we don’t hold on until\\n      expiration, and therefore, because both options will still contain some time value\\n      before that final month, our breakevens will be slightly more narrow, which of\\n      course helps us.\\n         In the previous example, we haven’t taken into account the rules, but let’s assume\\n      that there was an earnings announcement on, say, May 21. Let’s also assume that the\\n      three-month high had been $26.49 and the three-month low had been $16.39.

The risk we run with a Strangle\\n        is that the breakevens can be pushed further apart, which is bad, but where the\\n        difference is not too great (and that’s a judgment call), then the Strangle can be\\n        spectacular.\\n           The Strangle is the second easiest volatility strategy to understand, and we only\\n        look at it if the Straddle criteria have been obeyed. We simply buy lower strike puts\\n        and higher strike calls with the same expiration date so that we can profit from the\\n        stock soaring up or plummeting down. As with the Straddle, each leg of the trade\\n        has limited downside (i.e., the call or put premium) but uncapped upside.\\n           Again the same challenges apply regarding Bid/Ask Spreads and the psychology\\n        of the actual trade. Remember that time decay hurts long options positions because\\n        options are like wasting assets. The closer we get to expiration, the less time value\\n        there is in the option. Time decay accelerates exponentially during the last month\\n        before expiration, so we don’t want to hold onto OTM or ATM options into the last\\n        month.\\n           Use the Straddle rules but then make an adjustment for the Strangle:\\n        1. Instead of trading the ATM calls and puts, choose the next strike lower for the\\n            put and the next strike higher for the call.\\n        2. Now compare the breakeven scenarios for the Strangle to those for the\\n            Straddle. Typically the Strangle’s breakevens will be slightly wider. Now you\\n            must make a judgment between the cost of the Strangle and the likelihood of\\n            the stock moving explosively up or down. Because the rules have already\\n            passed, you should have established a good likelihood of a move happening.\\n        Again, it’s important to follow the entry and exit rules, and psychologically speak-\\n        ing, it’s another tough strategy to play after you’re in. It’s very easy to find reasons\\n        to exit, even though it’s in breach of your trading plan.

Therefore, the optimum\\n          time period to trade Strangles is with three months until expiration, but if the\\n          stock has not moved decisively, sell your position when there is one month to\\n          expiration.

In buying a second put, the strategy retains its preference for high volatil-\\n        ity but now with a more bearish slant.\\n            As with the Straddle, we choose the ATM strike for both legs, which means the\\n        strategy is expensive. We’re therefore requiring a pretty big move, preferably with\\n        the stock plunging downwards. As such, our risk is greater than with the Straddle,\\n        and our reward is still uncapped. Because we bought double the number of puts,\\n        our position improves at double the speed, so the breakeven to the downside is\\n        slightly tighter. The breakeven to the upside is the strike plus the net debit, which is\\n        more than the Straddle because we’ve bought double the amount of puts.\\n            Again the same challenges apply regarding Bid/Ask Spreads and the psychology\\n        of the actual trade. Remember that time decay hurts long options positions because\\n        options are like wasting assets. The closer we get to expiration, the less time value there\\n        is in the option. Time decay accelerates exponentially during the last month before\\n        expiration, so we don’t want to hold onto OTM or ATM options into the last month.\\n            Use the Straddle rules but buy twice as many puts as calls in order to make an\\n        adjustment for the Strip.\\n            Again, it’s important to follow the entry and exit rules (as for straddles), and psy-\\n        chologically speaking, this is another tough strategy to play after you’re in. It’s very\\n        easy to find reasons to exit, even though it’s in breach of your trading plan. But you\\n        must remember that you got in for a certain reason (or reasons), and you must stay\\n        in until one of your other reasons compels you to exit.\\n            Here’s a reminder of the rules for trading straddles that you must also apply to\\n        strips:\\n        1. Choose your preferred stock price range. Some traders choose stocks between\\n             $20.00 and $60.00, but that’s a personal preference.\\n        2. Only do a Strip on a stock that is close to making an announcement that may\\n             cause a surprise jump in the stock price either way, such as the week before an\\n             earnings report.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 589,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 173,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/173.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"                                                                        Volatility Strategies     133\\n      3. Buy ATM calls and puts with the expiration at least two months away, prefer-\\n          ably three. You can get away with four months if nothing else is available.\\n      4. The cost of the Straddle should be less than half of the stock’s recent high less\\n          its recent low. By recent, we mean the last 40 trading days for a two-month\\n          Straddle, the last 60 trading days for a three-month Straddle, or the last 80 days\\n          for a four-month Straddle. The point here is that the cost of the Straddle should\\n          be low in comparison with the potential of the stock to move. If this works\\n          with the Straddle, then the Strip can be acceptable.\\n      5. Exit within two weeks after the news event occurs. Never hold into the final\\n          month before expiration. During the final month, your options will suffer\\n          increasing time decay, which we don’t want to be exposed to.\\n      6. Try to find a stock that is forming a consolidation pattern, such as a flag or\\n          pennant, or in other words, where the stock price action has become tighter\\n          and where volatility has shrunk in advance of a big move in either direction.\\n          Typically we’re looking for a pennant within the context of a downward trend.\\n      Buy two ATM puts                               Buy ATM call                           Strip\\nSteps to Trading a Strip\\n      1.

In reality, we don’t hold on until\\n        expiration, and therefore because both options will still contain some time value\\n        before that final month, our breakevens will be slightly more narrow, which of\\n        course helps us.\\n           In the previous example, we’ve assumed that the rules required to make a\\n        Straddle have been passed in order for us to contemplate the Strip!\\n4.4 Strap\\nProficiency   Direction  Volatility Asset Legs          Max Risk   Max Reward       Strategy Type\\n                                        \\u0001                 !\\n                                        \\u0001\\nExpert        Bullish    High       ■ One Long Put      Capped     Uncapped         Capital Gain\\n                                    ■ Two Long Calls\\n4.4.1 Description\\n        The Strap is a simple adjustment to the Straddle to make it more biased to the\\n        upside. In buying a second call, the strategy retains its preference for high volatility\\n        but now with a more bullish slant.\\n           As with the Straddle, we choose the ATM strike for both legs, which means the\\n        strategy is expensive. We’re therefore requiring a pretty big move, preferably with\\n        the stock soaring upwards. As such, our risk is greater than with the Straddle, and\\n        our reward is still uncapped. Because we bought double the number of calls, our\\n        position improves at double the speed, so the breakeven to the upside is slightly\\n        tighter. The breakeven to the downside is the strike less the net debit, which is more\\n        than the Straddle because we’ve bought double the amount of calls.\\n           Again the same challenges apply regarding Bid/Ask Spreads and the psychology\\n        of the actual trade.

The closer we get to expiration, the less time value\\n      there is in the option. Time decay accelerates exponentially during the last month\\n      before expiration, so we don’t want to hold onto OTM or ATM options into the last\\n      month.\\n         Use the Straddle rules but buy twice as many calls as puts in order to make an\\n      adjustment for the Strap.\\n         Again, it’s important to follow the entry and exit rules (as for straddles), and psy-\\n      chologically speaking, it’s another tough strategy to play after you’re in. It’s very\\n      easy to find reasons to exit, even though it’s in breach of your trading plan. But you\\n      must remember that you got in for a certain reason (or reasons), and you must stay\\n      in until one of your other reasons compels you to exit.\\n         Here’s a reminder of the rules for trading straddles that you must also apply for\\n      straps:\\n      1. Choose your preferred stock price range. Some traders choose stocks between\\n          $20.00 and $60.00, but that’s a personal preference.\\n      2. Only do a Strap on a stock that is close to making an announcement, such as\\n          the week before an earnings report.\\n      3. Buy ATM calls and puts with the expiration at least two months away, prefer-\\n          ably three. You can get away with four months if nothing else is available.\\n      4. The cost of the Straddle should be less than half of the stock’s recent high less\\n          its recent low. By recent, we mean the last 40 trading days for a two-month\\n          Straddle, the last 60 trading days for a three-month Straddle, or the last\\n          80 days for a four-month Straddle. The point here is that the cost of the\\n          Straddle should be low in comparison with the potential of the stock to\\n          move. If this works with the Straddle, then the Strap can be acceptable.\\n      5. Exit within two weeks after the news event occurs. Never hold into the final\\n          month before expiration. During the final month, your options will suffer\\n          increasing time decay, which we don’t want to be exposed to.\\n      6. Try to find a stock that is forming a consolidation pattern, such as a flag or\\n          pennant, or in other words where the stock price action has become tighter\\n          and where volatility has shrunk in advance of a big move in either\\n          direction. Typically we’re looking for a pennant within the context of an\\n          upward trend.\\n      Buy ATM put                           Buy two ATM calls                            Strap\\nSteps to Trading a Strap\\n      1.

Instead of buying OTM options, we buy ITM calls and puts, which cre-\\n        ates a higher cost basis. As with the Strangle, the risk we run with a Guts is that the\\n        breakevens can be pushed further apart than with a Straddle.\\n           To even contemplate a Guts, the Straddle criteria must have been satisfied first.\\n        We buy higher strike puts and lower strike calls with the same expiration date so\\n        that we can profit from the stock soaring up or plummeting down. As with the\\n        Strangle, each leg of the trade has limited downside (i.e., the call or put premium)\\n        but uncapped upside.\\n           Again the same challenges apply regarding Bid/Ask Spreads and the psychology\\n        of the actual trade. Remember that time decay hurts long options positions because\\n        options are like wasting assets. The closer we get to expiration, the less time value\\n        there is in the option.\\n           Use the Straddle rules but then make an adjustment for the Guts:\\n        1. Instead of trading the ATM calls and puts, choose the next strike higher for the\\n            put and the next strike lower for the call.\\n        2. Now compare the breakeven scenarios for the Guts to the Straddle. Typically\\n            the Guts’ breakevens will be slightly wider. The Guts isn’t very attractive when\\n            compared to the Strangle, but you can always compare the two with the\\n            Straddle, using the Analyzer.\\n        Again, it’s important to follow the entry and exit rules, and psychologically speak-\\n        ing, it’s another tough strategy to play after you’re in. It’s very easy to find reasons\\n        to exit, even though it’s in breach of your Trading Plan. But you must remember that\\n        you got in for a certain reason (or reasons), and you must stay in until one of your\\n        other reasons compels you to exit.\\n        Buy ITM call                            Buy ITM put                                  Guts\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 600,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 184,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/184.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"Steps to Trading a Guts\\n      1.

Generally, a Guts is\\n          prohibitively expensive, and it would be better to carry out a long Strangle\\n          instead.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 601,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 185,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/185.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"                                                                     Volatility Strategies  145\\nNet Position\\n       ■  This is a net debit transaction because you have bought calls and puts.\\n       ■  Your maximum risk on the trade itself is limited to the net debit of the bought\\n          calls and puts less the difference between the strikes.

The reason that short butterflies\\n        aren’t particularly popular is because even though they produce a net credit, they\\n        offer very small returns compared to straddles and strangles with only slightly less\\n        risk.\\n            The Short Call Butterfly involves a low strike short call, two ATM long calls, and\\n        an OTM short call. The resulting position is profitable in the event of a big move by\\n        the stock. The problem is that the reward is seriously capped and is typically\\n        dwarfed by the potential risk if the stock fails to move.\\n        Sell lower           Buy middle        Buy middle         Sell higher         Short Call\\n        strike call          strike call       strike call        strike call         Butterfly\\nSteps to Trading a Short Call Butterfly\\n        1.

You are looking for\\n          large volatility in the stock price, but you are not concerned with the direction.\\nRationale\\n       ■  With short butterflies, you are looking to execute a limited yielding trade at a\\n          net credit whereby your maximum profits occur if the stock finishes on either\\n          side of the upper and lower strike prices at expiration.\\n       ■  You are anticipating high volatility with the stock price, which will lead you to\\n          profit.\\nNet Position\\n       ■  This is a net credit trade.\\n       ■  Your maximum risk is the difference between the adjacent strike prices less the\\n          net credit. (Remember that the upper and lower strike prices are equidistant to\\n          the middle strike price.) Your maximum reward is the net credit you receive.\\nEffect of Time Decay\\n       ■  Time decay is generally harmful to your trade here because you are looking for\\n          a lot of movement in the stock price.

It is the opposite of a Long Put Butterfly, which is a rangebound\\n        strategy. The reason that short butterflies aren’t particularly popular is because even\\n        though they produce a net credit, they offer very small returns compared with strad-\\n        dles and strangles with only slightly less risk.\\n            The Short Put Butterfly involves a low strike short put, two ATM long puts, and\\n        an ITM short put. The resulting position is profitable in the event of a big move by\\n        the stock. The problem is that the reward is seriously capped and is typically\\n        dwarfed by the potential risk if the stock fails to move.\\n        Sell lower           Buy middle       Buy middle              Sell higher            Short Put\\n        strike put           strike put       strike put              strike put             Butterfly\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 609,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 193,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/193.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"                                                                      Volatility Strategies 153\\nSteps to Trading a Short Put Butterfly\\n      1.

The Short Call Condor is another volatility strat-\\n        egy and is the opposite of a Long Call Condor, which is a rangebound strategy. Short\\n        condors aren’t particularly popular because even though they produce a net credit, they\\n        offer very small returns compared to straddles and strangles, with only slightly less risk.\\n            The Short Call Condor involves a low strike short call, a lower middle ITM long\\n        call, a higher middle OTM long call, and a higher OTM short call. The resulting posi-\\n        tion yields a position that is profitable in the event of a big move by the stock. Again,\\n        the problem is that the reward is seriously capped and is typically dwarfed by the\\n        potential risk if the stock fails to move.\\n        Sell lower          Buy middle          Buy middle           Sell higher            Short Call\\n        strike call         strike call         strike call          strike call            Condor\\nSteps to Trading a Short Call Condor\\n        1.

It is the opposite of a Long Put Condor, which is a rangebound strat-\\n        egy. Short condors aren’t particularly popular because even though they produce a\\n        net credit, they offer very small returns compared to straddles and strangles with\\n        only slightly less risk.\\n            The Short Put Condor involves a low strike short put, a lower middle OTM long\\n        put, a higher middle ITM long put, and a higher ITM short put. The resulting posi-\\n        tion is profitable in the event of a big move by the stock. Again, the problem is that\\n        the reward is seriously capped and is typically dwarfed by the potential risk if the\\n        stock fails to move.\\n        Sell lower          Buy middle           Buy middle            Sell higher             Short Put\\n        strike put          strike put           strike put            strike put              Condor\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 618,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 202,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/202.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"Steps to Trading a Short Put Condor\\n      1.

The higher strike put shares the same strike as the lower strike call to\\n        create the Short Butterfly shape. The resulting position is profitable in the event of a\\n        big move by the stock. The problem is that the reward is seriously capped and is typ-\\n        ically dwarfed by the potential risk if the stock fails to move.\\n        Sell lower            Buy middle      Buy middle           Sell higher         Short Iron\\n        strike put            strike put      strike call          strike call         Butterfly\\nSteps to Trading a Short Iron Butterfly\\n        1.

The Short Iron Condor differs from the\\n        Short Iron Butterfly in that the middle strikes are separated.\\n            Short iron condors aren’t particularly popular because they produce a net debit\\n        and offer very small returns compared to straddles and strangles with only slightly\\n        less risk.\\n            The Short Iron Condor involves putting together a Bear Put Spread and a higher\\n        strike Bull Call Spread. The higher strike put has a lower strike than the lower strike\\n        call to create the Short Condor shape. The resulting position is profitable in the event\\n        of a big move by the stock. The problem is that the reward is seriously capped and\\n        is typically dwarfed by the potential risk if the stock fails to move.\\n        Sell lower          Buy middle         Buy middle            Sell higher         Short Iron\\n        strike put          strike put         strike call           strike call         Condor\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 627,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 211,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/211.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"                                                                      Volatility Strategies 171\\nSteps to Trading a Short Iron Condor\\n      1.

We’re looking for a stock that is not going to explode\\n     with high volatility; rather, it’s going to trade in a tight channel, preferably between\\n     clear levels of support and resistance.\\n        So, bearing that in mind, would you look to trade a sideways strategy shortly\\n     before a news event like an earnings report? Heck, no! Get the news out of the\\n     way first, and then we have a greater chance of the stock meandering sideways,\\n     hopefully.\\n        Sideways strategies can be challenging to trade, psychologically speaking. The\\n     reason is that as the stock touches support, we don’t actually know if support will\\n     hold or not; likewise for resistance. So there can be some anxious moments at those\\n     times where support or resistance is within touching distance.\\n        For this reason, it’s best for the inexperienced trader not to consider uncapped\\n     risk strategies such as the Short Straddles, Short Strangles, and Short Guts. These are\\n     the precise opposite of their long versions we reviewed in Chapter 4, “Volatility\\n     Strategies.” In this section, we’ll cover those risky strategies first and then show how\\n     we can reduce the risk by adding buy legs to create more balanced strategies that\\n     have more attractive risk/reward ratios.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 632,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 216,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/216.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"Sideways Strategies Staircase\\n        This diagram shows how the various sideways strategies link together, highlighting\\n        their similarities and differences.

We short ATM puts\\n      and calls with a short time to expiration (one month or less) in order to pick up\\n      income. Because we’re short options, time decay works for us, so we only select\\n      short-term expiration dates. Also we’re exposed to potentially unlimited risk, which\\n      is another reason for making this a short-term strategy. As such, it’s not one I’d rec-\\n      ommend to inexperienced traders. The problem is that you could be successful at it\\n      for months, picking up modest income over and over again, and then whooomph,\\n      one big loss will wipe out years worth of gains. It’s not worth it.\\n          Each leg of the trade has uncapped downside. If the stock starts going ballistic in\\n      either direction, then your position is precarious to say the least. If the stock remains\\n      rangebound, then we’ll make a limited profit. But it’s not enough for me to get\\n      excited. If the stock gaps in either direction, we’re history!\\n          As such, this module will be largely academic (I hope) to your practical trading\\n      experience; however, it’s worth studying so you can compare it to the other range-\\n      bound strategies in this chapter. One thing to note is that you would never trade this\\n      strategy right before a news event like an earnings report. You certainly wouldn’t\\n      want any nasty surprises to be lurking around the corner.\\n      Sell ATM put                         Sell ATM call                           Short Straddle\\nSteps to Trading a Short Straddle\\n      1.

Instead of selling ATM options, we sell OTM calls and puts, which means a\\n      lower net credit but typically wider breakeven points.\\n         The Short Strangle is precisely the opposite of a (Long) Strangle. We short OTM\\n      puts and calls with a short time to expiration (one month or less) in order to pick up\\n      income. Because we’re short options, time decay works for us, so we only select\\n      short-term expiration dates. Also we’re exposed to potentially unlimited risk, which\\n      is another reason for making this a short-term strategy. Again, it’s not one I’d rec-\\n      ommend to inexperienced traders. It’s worth reemphasizing that the problem is that\\n      you could be successful at it for months, picking up modest income over and over\\n      again, and then wham, one big loss will wipe out years worth of gains.\\n         Each leg of the trade has uncapped downside. If the stock starts going ballistic in\\n      either direction, then your position is precarious to say the least. If the stock remains\\n      rangebound, then we’ll make a limited profit. But it’s not enough for me to get\\n      excited. If the stock gaps in either direction, we’re history!\\n         You would never trade this strategy right before a news event like an earnings report.\\n      You certainly wouldn’t want any nasty surprises to be lurking around the corner.\\n      Sell OTM put                         Sell OTM call                           Short Strangle\\nSteps to Trading a Short Strangle\\n      1.

Instead of selling OTM options, we sell ITM calls and puts, which creates a\\n      higher net credit. As with Short Straddles and Short Strangles, the risk we run with\\n      a Short Guts is uncapped on either side.\\n         The Short Guts is precisely the opposite of a (Long) Guts. We short ITM puts and\\n      calls with a short time to expiration (one month or less) in order to pick up income.\\n      Because we’re short options, time decay works for us, so we only select short-term\\n      expiration dates. Also we’re exposed to potentially unlimited risk, which is another\\n      reason for making this a short-term strategy. It’s not one I’d recommend. The addi-\\n      tional risk you face with a Short Guts is that each of the strikes is ITM, and therefore\\n      you could be exercised early, so stay away from this strategy!\\n         Each leg of the trade has uncapped downside. If the stock starts going ballistic in\\n      either direction, then your position is precarious to say the least. If the stock remains\\n      rangebound, then we’ll make a limited profit.\\n         You would never trade this strategy right before a news event like an earnings report.\\n      You certainly wouldn’t want any nasty surprises to be lurking around the corner.\\n      Sell ITM call                           Sell ITM put                            Short Guts\\nSteps to Trading a Short Guts\\n      1. Sell ITM (lower) strike calls, preferably with one month or less to expiration.\\n      2. Sell ITM (higher) strike puts with the same expiration.\\n           Steps In\\n           ■   Try to ensure that the trend is rangebound and identify clear areas of\\n               support and resistance.\\n           ■   Try to ensure that no news is coming out soon for the stock.\\n           Steps Out\\n           ■   Manage your position according to the rules defined in your Trading Plan.\\n           ■   Close the losing side by buying back the relevant option if the stock breaks\\n               support or resistance.\\n           ■   Buy back both options if the position is profitable but you think news may\\n               emerge about the underlying stock.\\n5.3.2 Context\\nOutlook\\n      ■    With Short Guts, your outlook is direction neutral\\u0002you are looking for no\\n           movement in the stock.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 642,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 226,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/226.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"Rationale\\n       ■  To execute a direction-neutral income strategy for a net credit while expecting\\n          a future decline in volatility. Ideally you are looking for a scenario where the\\n          immediate Implied Volatility has been high, giving you above average options\\n          premiums, but where you anticipate the stock to consolidate (become less\\n          volatile) and remain rangebound for the duration of your trade.\\n       ■  Because the options are ITM, a Short Guts can raise a significant net credit into\\n          your account. This makes a Short Guts a plausible hedging strategy against\\n          something like a long Straddle or long Strangle, for example.\\nNet Position\\n       ■  This is a net credit trade because you have sold calls and puts.\\n       ■  Your maximum risk on the trade itself is unlimited, whereas your maximum\\n          reward is limited to the net credit you receive for selling the calls and puts less\\n          the difference in strike prices.\\nEffect of Time Decay\\n       ■  Time decay is helpful to a Short Guts.

Long butterflies are quite popular\\n      because they offer a good risk/reward ratio, together with low cost. The long\\n      options at the outside strikes ensure that the risk is capped on both sides, and this is\\n      a much more conservative strategy than the Short Straddle.\\n          The Long Call Butterfly involves a low strike long call, two ATM short calls, and an\\n      OTM long call. The resulting is profitable in the event of rangebound action by the\\n      stock. Although the risk/reward ratio is attractive, the problem is that the maximum\\n      reward is restricted to the scenario where the stock is at the middle strike at expiration.\\n      Buy lower             Sell middle    Sell middle            Buy higher            Long Call\\n      strike call           strike call    strike call            strike call           Butterfly\\nSteps to Trading a Long Call Butterfly\\n      1.

Buy one higher strike (OTM) call.\\n           ■   All options share the same expiration date for this strategy.\\n           ■   For this strategy, you must use all calls.\\n           ■   Remember that there should be equal distance between each strike price.\\n               The maximum reward occurs if the stock is at the middle strike at expiration.\\n           Steps In\\n           ■   Try to ensure that the trend is rangebound and identify clear areas of sup-\\n               port and resistance.\\n           ■   Try to ensure that no news is coming out soon for the stock.\\n           Steps Out\\n           ■   Manage your position according to the rules defined in your Trading Plan.\\n           ■   If the stock veers outside your stop loss areas above or below the stock\\n               price, then unravel the entire position.\\n           ■   You can unravel the position just before expiration—remember to include\\n               all the commissions in your calculations.\\n5.4.2 Context\\nOutlook\\n      ■    With long butterflies, your profile is direction neutral—you expect very little\\n           movement in the stock price.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 646,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 230,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/230.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"Rationale\\n       ■  With long butterflies, you are looking to execute a potentially high-yielding\\n          trade at very low cost, where your maximum profits occur if the stock is at the\\n          middle strike price at expiration.\\n       ■  You are anticipating very low volatility in the stock price.\\nNet Position\\n       ■  This is a net debit trade, although the net cost is typically low.\\n       ■  Your maximum risk is the net debit of the bought and sold options. Your maxi-\\n          mum reward is the difference between adjacent strike prices less the net debit.\\n          (Remember that the upper and lower strike prices are equidistant to the mid-\\n          dle strike price).\\nEffect of Time Decay\\n       ■  Time decay is helpful to this position when it is profitable and harmful when\\n          the position is unprofitable. When you enter the trade, typically the stock price\\n          will be in the profitable area of the risk profile, so from that perspective, time\\n          decay harms the position.\\nAppropriate Time Period to Trade\\n       ■  One month or less.\\nSelecting the Stock\\n       ■  Choose from stocks with adequate liquidity, preferably over 500,000 Average\\n          Daily Volume (ADV).\\n       ■  Try to ensure that the trend is rangebound and identify clear areas of support\\n          and resistance.\\n       ■  Select a stock price range you feel comfortable with. Some traders look to\\n          avoid stocks under $20.00, claiming the need for adequate wingspan between\\n          the breakeven points for the best chance of success.

Long butterflies are quite popular\\n        because they offer a good risk/reward ratio, together with low cost. The long\\n        options at the outside strikes ensure that the risk is capped on both sides, and this is\\n        a much more conservative strategy than the Short Straddle.\\n            The Long Put Butterfly involves a low strike long put, two ATM short puts, and\\n        an ITM long put. The resulting positionis profitable in the event of rangebound\\n        action by the stock. Although the risk/reward ratio is attractive, the problem is that\\n        the maximum reward is restricted to the scenario where the stock is at the middle\\n        strike at expiration.\\n        Buy lower            Sell middle      Sell middle            Buy higher              Long Put\\n        strike put           strike put       strike put             strike put              Butterfly\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 650,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 234,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/234.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"Steps to Trading a Long Put Butterfly\\n      1.

The Long Call Condor is another range-\\n        bound strategy and is the opposite of a Short Call Condor, which is a volatility strat-\\n        egy. Long condors are quite popular because they offer a good risk/reward ratio,\\n        together with low cost. The long options at the outside strikes ensure that the risk is\\n        capped on both sides, and this is a much more conservative strategy than the Short\\n        Strangle.\\n            The Long Call Condor involves a low strike long call, a lower middle ITM short\\n        call, a higher middle OTM short call, and a higher OTM long call. The resulting posi-\\n        tion is profitable in the event of the stock remaining rangebound. Here the\\n        risk/reward ratio is attractive, and the profitable area of the risk profile is wider\\n        than that of the Long Butterfly.\\n        Buy lower           Sell middle        Sell middle       Buy higher          Long Call\\n        strike call         strike call        strike call       strike call         Condor\\nSteps to Trading a Long Call Condor\\n        1.

Long condors are quite popular because\\n        they offer a good risk/reward ratio, together with low cost. The long options at the\\n        outside strikes ensure that the risk is capped on both sides, and this is a much more\\n        conservative strategy than the Short Strangle.\\n            The Long Put Condor involves a low strike long put, a lower middle OTM Short\\n        Put, a higher middle ITM Short Put, and a higher ITM Long Put. The resulting posi-\\n        tion yields a position that is profitable in the event of the stock remaining range-\\n        bound. Here the risk/reward ratio is attractive, and the profitable area of the risk\\n        profile is wider than that of the Long Butterfly.\\n        Buy lower           Sell middle        Sell middle        Buy higher           Long Put\\n        strike put          strike put         strike put         strike put           Condor\\nSteps to Trading a Long Put Condor\\n        1.

As such, we make our biggest profits if the stock remains around the\\n        middle strike, but we can still make a profit if the stock breaks to the upside.\\n            This is a fiddly strategy and should only be used if you have an analyzer handy;\\n        otherwise, it would be easy to miscalculate your risk profile. But in terms of its use-\\n        fulness, the Modified Butterfly is extremely useful for butterfly enthusiasts who\\n        need some flexibility.\\n            The Modified Call Butterfly involves a low strike long call, two ATM short calls,\\n        and an OTM long call. The resulting position is profitable in the event of rangebound\\n        or rising action by the stock. Although the risk/reward ratio is attractive, the prob-\\n        lem remains that the maximum reward is restricted to the scenario where the stock\\n        is at the middle strike at expiration.\\n        Buy lower            Sell middle      Sell middle       Buy higher          Modified Call\\n        strike call          strike call      strike call       strike call         Butterfly\\nSteps to Trading a Modified Call Butterfly\\n        1.

The ratio backspreads involve\\n        buying more options than selling, so there is uncapped upside at an accelerated rate.\\n        The ratio spreads involve selling more options than buying, so there is uncapped\\n        downside at an accelerated rate.

Ratio backspreads are\\n        advanced strategies and are fun to play when you’ve mastered other, more straight-\\n        forward strategies.

Increasing volatility is very\\n      helpful because we’re net long in calls. The worst thing that can happen is that the\\n      stock doesn’t move at all, and even a sharp move down can be profitable, or at the\\n      very least, preferable to no movement at all.\\n          The Call Ratio Backspread involves buying and selling different numbers of the\\n      same expiration calls. Typically we buy and sell calls in a ratio of 2:1 or 3:2, so we\\n      are always a net buyer. This gives us the uncapped profit potential. It also reduces\\n      the net cost of doing the deal such that we can even create a net credit! Furthermore,\\n      our risk is capped, though we need to investigate the strategy further in order to\\n      understand it more.\\n      Sell lower strike call            Buy two higher strike calls       Call Ratio Backspread\\n      or:\\n      Sell two lower strike calls       Buy three higher strike calls     Call Ratio Backspread\\nSteps to Trading a Call Ratio Backspread\\n      1. Sell one or two lower strike calls.\\n      2. Buy two or three higher strike calls with the same expiration date.

Increasing volatility is very helpful because we’re net long in puts. The\\n        worst thing that can happen is that the stock doesn’t move at all, and even a sharp\\n        move up can be profitable, or at the very least, preferable to no movement at all.\\n           The Put Ratio Backspread involves buying and selling different numbers of the\\n        same expiration puts. Typically we buy and sell puts in a ratio of 2:1 or 3:2, so we are\\n        always a net buyer. This gives us the uncapped profit potential. It also reduces the\\n        net cost of doing the deal such that we can even create a net credit! Furthermore, our\\n        risk is capped, though we need to investigate the strategy further in order to under-\\n        stand it better.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 681,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 265,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/265.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"                                                                     Leveraged Strategies      225\\n      Buy two lower strike puts          Sell higher strike put           Put Ratio Backspread\\n      or:\\n      Buy three lower strike puts        Sell two higher strike puts      Put Ratio Backspread\\nSteps to Trading a Put Ratio Backspread\\n      1.

This means we’re exposed to uncapped risk and can only make a lim-\\n        ited reward. As such, this is an undesirable strategy, and you’d be better off trading\\n        one of the long butterflies.\\n            Increasing volatility is harmful to this strategy because of our exposure to\\n        uncapped risk. The best thing that can happen is that the stock doesn’t move at all.\\n            The Ratio Call Spread involves buying and selling different numbers of the same\\n        expiration calls. Typically we sell and buy calls in a ratio of 2:1 or 3:2, so we are\\n        always a net seller. This gives us the uncapped risk potential. It also reduces the net\\n        cost of doing the deal such that we create a net credit.\\n        Buy lower strike call               Sell two higher strike calls           Ratio Call Spread\\n        or:\\n        Buy two lower strike calls          Sell three higher strike calls         Ratio Call Spread\\nSteps to Trading a Ratio Call Spread\\n        1.

As such, this is an undesirable strategy, and you’d be better off trading one\\n        of the long butterflies.\\n           Increasing volatility is harmful to this strategy because of our exposure to\\n        uncapped risk. The best thing that can happen is that the stock doesn’t move at all.\\n           The Ratio Put Spread involves buying and selling different numbers of the same\\n        expiration puts. Typically we sell and buy puts in a ratio of 2:1 or 3:2, so we are\\n        always a net seller. This gives us the uncapped risk potential. It also reduces the net\\n        cost of doing the deal such that we create a net credit.\\n        Sell two lower strike puts             Buy higher strike put               Ratio Put Spread\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 690,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 274,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/274.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"      or:\\n      Sell three lower strike puts          Buy two higher strike puts        Ratio Put Spread\\nSteps to Trading a Ratio Put Spread\\n      1.

As such, we can\\n     re-create the underlying asset synthetically using only options. We can re-create long\\n     and short positions for straddles by using a combination of buying and selling stocks\\n     and options together. We can re-create the same risk profile shape as a Long Call or\\n     Long Put by combining other assets together. Often, these synthetic strategies come\\n     into being when you’re looking to repair an existing strategy.\\n        In this chapter, we’ll cover the long and short synthetic straddles, which mimic\\n     those that we discussed in Chapter 4, “Volatility Strategies.” Whereas a long strad-\\n     dle involves buying an ATM call and put together, a Long Synthetic Straddle can be\\n     constructed using the stock with calls or the stock with puts. The advantage of\\n     understanding how these synthetic strategies are created is not only the flexibility it\\n     affords us as traders but also the adaptability to morph an existing position into\\n     something else simply by adding or taking away a leg of the trade. For example, if\\n     you’re already long in a stock, but you think it may be about to reverse, you could\\n     buy puts to create either a Synthetic Call or double the number of puts, which would\\n     create a Long Put Synthetic Straddle.\\n        Consequently, even Long Call and Put positions have their synthetic equivalents.\\n     The beauty of options is that we can create virtually any risk profile, although that\\n     beauty largely exists in an academic sense if you have the time and passion to pur-\\n     sue it! When it comes to actual trading, it’s best to keep things simple while having\\n     a grasp of the more complex. It’s always best to trade “within yourself,” or in other\\n     words, to know that your intellect isn’t being stretched by the trade you’re currently\\n     involved in. The “stretching” should happen outside trading hours. When you’re\\n     making trading decisions, you need to concentrate purely on the trading plan in\\n     question.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 696,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 280,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/280.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"            Aside from the synthetic calls, puts, and straddles, we’ll also cover the Long and\\n        Short Synthetic Futures, which use options to synthetically re-create the underlying\\n        position. The combos are variations of the synthetic futures, which both have long\\n        and short versions.\\n            However, the first strategy we’re going to cover in this chapter is the Collar. The\\n        Collar is a great strategy that somehow doesn’t fit into any other chapter of this\\n        book! The Collar is similar to a long dated Covered Call, but we add a long put to\\n        insure the downside. The effect is that we buy the stock, insure it with a Long Put,\\n        and finance the insurance with a higher strike short call. Where volatility is high and\\n        sentiment is bullish, it’s possible to create risk-free collars, notwithstanding the fact\\n        that there is the net debit (largely of buying the stock) to consider. As such, the Collar\\n        is a low-risk but expensive strategy.\\n            In some senses, this is the most challenging chapter to follow, and these are cer-\\n        tainly among the more awkward strategies to produce algorithms for, particularly\\n        the synthetic straddles. When you’re attempting these strategies, paper trading or\\n        otherwise, use online tools so that you can take the math for granted, and just con-\\n        centrate on the risk profile you’re creating and whether it fits your intended trading\\n        plan and expectations. Many of the strategies in this chapter will have far-reaching\\n        tax consequences of which you and your accountant will need to be aware.\\n7.1 Collar\\nProficiency      Direction  Volatility    Asset Legs     Max Risk    Max Reward     Strategy Type\\n                            N/A                 \\u0001         !\\n                                                \\u0001\\nIntermediate     Bullish                  ■ Long Stock   Capped      Capped         Capital Gain\\n                                          ■ Long Put\\n                                          ■ Short Call\\n7.1.1 Description\\n        The Collar is similar to a Covered Call but typically works over a much longer time\\n        period and involves another leg—buying a put to insure against the stock falling.\\n        The effect is of buying a stock, insuring against a down-move by buying puts, and\\n        then insuring the trade by selling calls.\\n        Buy stock       ➞    Buy asset\\n        Buy puts        ➞    Insure it from falling\\n        Sell calls      ➞    Finance the insurance\\n        The risk profile therefore contains a capped downside because of the Long Put and\\n        a capped upside because of the Short Call.

The amount of upside depends on\\n      the position of the higher strike call and how much you receive for selling the call.\\n      As such, there is an art to creating a good collar! Typically, high volatility is helpful,\\n      particularly in a bull market where demand for calls is higher and where they are\\n      priced higher than the equivalent puts.\\n         The nature of a Collar is cautious. Don’t expect wild returns, because the sold\\n      calls will prevent that from happening. The Collar works best over a longer peri-\\n      od of time, so you’re rarely looking a more than a 20% return over a year, depend-\\n      ing on how much risk you’re prepared to take. However, the trade-off is that the\\n      risk, in terms of your outlay on the stock, will be tiny. And that’s the beauty of a\\n      Collar.\\n         The Collar is particularly useful when you can’t afford to lose much on a trade,\\n      but you still want to participate in upside market action over, say, a 12- to 18-month\\n      period. You’re happy to place the trade and simply leave it alone until expiration or\\n      very close to it. The disadvantage to a Collar is that you really do have to wait until\\n      (near) expiration to fully benefit from the strategy, but bearing in mind that the\\n      Collar gives you such low risk, it’s a price you’re willing to pay.\\n      Buy stock                Buy ATM put                Sell OTM call                 Collar\\nSteps to Trading a Collar\\n      1.

This is supposed to be a\\n          very low-risk strategy.\\nRationale\\n      ■   To execute a long-term trade that is inherently low-risk. You will have to use\\n          online tools to determine how little risk you’re going to take.\\n      ■   Obviously, with any long-term trade that takes money out of your account,\\n          there is “opportunity cost.” This is the interest that you could have made on\\n          the net debit amount had you invested it in bonds or received simple interest\\n          payments on it.\\nNet Position\\n      ■   This is a net debit trade because money will come out of your account to pay\\n          for the stock. This is different from actual risk. If you select the right strike\\n          prices for the bought put and sold call, you may even be able to execute this\\n          trade with no risk at expiration, even though money has been debited from\\n          your account in order to make the trade. You will need to verify the risk\\n          profile with the option prices and available strikes—it’s not always possible\\n          to create a risk-free trade, but your best chance will come with longer to\\n          expiration during bullish market conditions, where puts are priced cheaper\\n          than calls!\\n      ■   If you are lucky with the availability of both friendly options premiums and\\n          strikes, you may be able to structure a low-risk, risk-free, or even a guaranteed\\n          return trade. This is because your long position in the stock will rise up to\\n          the point of the sold call strike price, giving you a profitable (albeit limited)\\n          upside. If the stock falls, then the ATM put (your insurance) will rise in value,\\n          and you will retain the premium received by having sold the OTM call. This\\n          combination will offset the fall in value of the long stock.\\nEffect of Time Decay\\n      ■   Time decay will be helpful with the sold call; it will be unhelpful to the bought\\n          put and will have no effect on the stock you have bought.\\n      ■   The net effect is that time decay is helpful here when the position is profitable\\n          and harmful when the position is loss-making.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 699,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 283,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/283.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"                                                                        Synthetic Strategies  243\\nAppropriate Time Period to Trade\\n     ■   It’s more likely that you will find the better Collar opportunities (in terms\\n         of risk containment) further out in time.

Use online tools to evaluate your risk/reward scenarios.\\n     ■   Expiration—Typically the best Collars can be found with at least one year to\\n         expiration. You can, if you want to experiment, buy only a six-month put if\\n         you think you only need insurance for a set period of time, but the authentic\\n         Collar uses the same expiration dates for both put and call.

Did it go up or down? If it went down, I’ll bet you wished\\n        you’d bought some insurance! Well, that’s what a Synthetic Call is. Basically, we buy\\n        the stock, but we insure against a downturn by buying an ATM or slightly OTM\\n        (lower strike) put. The net effect is that of creating the same shape as a standard long\\n        call but with the same leverage as buying the stock.\\n           In simple terms, this means that we’re capping our downside in case the stock\\n        unexpectedly drops through our stop loss. The long put will increase in value if the\\n        stock collapses, thereby countering the loss in value of the long stock position. This\\n        makes the Synthetic Call a very useful strategy for backing a hunch (not a very sci-\\n        entific way to trade, but that’s why you’d look to insure it) or for speculating before,\\n        say, an earnings report or an FDA decision (for a drug stock).\\n           The risk profile therefore contains a capped downside because of the long put and\\n        an uncapped upside because of the long stock position. The result looks like a long\\n        call but isn’t one! The level of insurance depends on where you place the put strike\\n        and the cost of the put.\\n        Buy stock                              Buy put                               Synthetic Call\\nSteps to Trading a Synthetic Call\\n        1.

To create the Straddle shape, we have to buy twice the\\n      number of puts. So for every 100 shares we buy, we have to buy two put contracts,\\n      which represent 200 shares of the stock. The Long Stock position replicates the action\\n      of buying the same number of calls as puts. Because we’re buying stock to counter-\\n      act the long puts in this case, the Long Put Synthetic Straddle is an expensive strat-\\n      egy, requiring a large net debit.\\n      Buy stock                     Buy two puts                     Long Put Synthetic Straddle\\nSteps to Trading a Long Put Synthetic Straddle\\n      1. Buy the stock (if trading U.S. stocks, sell 50 shares for every put contract you buy).\\n      2. Buy two ATM puts per 100 shares you buy. If the current stock price isn’t near\\n          the nearest strike price, then it’s better to choose the nearest ITM strike (higher\\n          than the current stock price).\\n          Steps In\\n          ■   Actively seek chart patterns that appear like pennant formations, signifying\\n              a consolidating price pattern.\\n          ■   Try to concentrate on stocks with news events and earnings reports about\\n              to happen within two weeks.\\n          ■   Choose a stock price range you feel comfortable with. Some traders prefer a\\n              middle range between $20.00 and $50.00.\\n          Steps Out\\n          ■   Manage your position according to the rules defined in your Trading Plan.\\n          ■   Exit either a few days after the news event occurs if there is no movement,\\n              or after the news event if there has been profitable movement.\\n          ■   If the stock thrusts up, sell the stock (making a profit for the entire position)\\n              and wait for a retracement to profit from the puts.\\n          ■   If the stock thrusts down, sell the puts (making a profit for the entire posi-\\n              tion) and wait for a retracement to profit from the stock.\\n          ■   Never hold into the last month.\\n7.5.2 Context\\nOutlook\\n     ■    With a long Synthetic Straddle, your outlook is neutral in terms of direction,\\n          but you’re looking for increasing volatility in the stock so that the stock price\\n          moves beyond your breakeven points on either side.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 716,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 300,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/300.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"Rationale\\n      ■   To execute a direction neutral trade where you expect the stock to behave with\\n          increasing volatility in either direction.\\n      ■   If the stock rises explosively, you will make money from your long stock posi-\\n          tion, which will rise faster than your Long Put position falls.\\n      ■   If the stock falls, you will profit from your Long Put position, which will\\n          increase in value faster than your long stock position loses value beyond the\\n          price you paid for the puts.\\nNet Position\\n      ■   This is a net debit trade because you are buying the stock and the puts.\\nEffect of Time Decay\\n      ■   Time decay is harmful to the value of your Long Puts.

them for inexperienced traders.\\n           Instead of selling calls and puts together, we create the same risk profile by com-\\n        bining short calls or puts with a long or short position in the stock.\\n           The Short Call Synthetic Straddle involves selling calls and counteracting them\\n        with a long stock position. To create the short straddle shape, we have to sell twice\\n        the number of calls. So for every 100 shares we buy, we have to sell two call con-\\n        tracts, which represent 200 shares of the stock.\\n        Buy stock                   Sell two calls                   Short Call Synthetic Straddle\\nSteps to Trading a Short Call Synthetic Straddle\\n        1. Buy the stock (if trading U.S. stocks, sell 50 shares for every call contract you\\n            buy).\\n        2. Sell two ATM calls per 100 shares you sell. If the current stock price isn’t near\\n            the nearest strike price, then it’s better to choose an OTM strike (higher than\\n            the current stock price).\\n            Steps In\\n            ■   Try to ensure that the trend is rangebound and identify clear areas of sup-\\n                port and resistance.\\n            ■   Try to ensure that no news is coming out imminently for the stock.\\n            Steps Out\\n            ■   Manage your position according to the rules defined in your Trading Plan.\\n            ■   Close the losing side by unraveling the relevant side if the stock breaks in\\n                either direction.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 720,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 304,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/304.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"          ■   Unravel the entire trade if the position is profitable and you think news\\n              may emerge about the underlying stock.\\n7.6.2 Context\\nOutlook\\n      ■   With a Short Synthetic Straddle, your outlook is direction neutral—you are\\n          looking for no movement in the stock and reducing volatility.\\nRationale\\n      ■   To execute a direction neutral trade where you expect the stock to be range-\\n          bound and behave with reduced volatility.\\nNet Position\\n      ■   If you’re trading stocks, this is a net debit transaction because you are buying\\n          the stock and receiving only a fraction of that credit for the Short Call options.\\n      ■   Your maximum risk is uncapped if the stock moves explosively in either\\n          direction.\\n      ■   Your maximum reward is capped and occurs at the strike price.\\nEffect of Time Decay\\n      ■   Time decay is helpful to your Short Call position.\\nAppropriate Time Period to Trade\\n      ■   One month or less.\\nSelecting the Stock\\n      ■   Choose from stocks with adequate liquidity, preferably over 500,000 Average\\n          Daily Volume (ADV).\\n      ■   Try to ensure that the trend is rangebound and identify clear areas of support\\n          and resistance.\\n      ■   Try to ensure that no news is coming out imminently for the stock.\\nSelecting the Options\\n      ■   Choose options with adequate liquidity;

You will then be short in two puts,\\n          which you may have to buy back or hedge in order to avoid an unlimited risk\\n          position. Alternatively, you can simply unravel the entire spread.\\n      ■   If the stock hits the lower price band, triggering your stop loss, then you\\n          should buy back your sold puts. If you buy back just half of your sold puts,\\n          you will have created a “Covered Put” risk profile.

If your incentive for this strategy is a tax\\n      play, you should consult with your tax advisor beforehand to evaluate whether or\\n      not it is valid where you live.\\n          The strategy involves creating a lower strike Long Synthetic Future and counter-\\n      ing it with a higher strike Short Synthetic Future. The long and short positions can-\\n      cel each other out, and we’re left with a straight horizontal line. The trick is to ensure\\n      that the sum of our net purchases is less than the sum of our net sales in order to\\n      make a profit. Remember, there are four legs in this strategy, two longs and two\\n      shorts, and the strategy is typically a net debit because we’re buying ITM options\\n      and selling OTM options.\\n          Some traders who are sitting on vast capital gains will seek to close out the loss-\\n      making legs of the strategy just before the end of the tax year, thereby setting off\\n      those losses against their gains and reducing their capital gains tax bill for that year.\\n      However, we need to remember that any open short positions are generally treated\\n      as 100% gains until the position is closed.\\n          High volatility is good for the Long Box, particularly if we’re looking to conduct\\n      the type of trade outlined previously, where we leg in and out. Ideally, we want a big\\n      fall followed by a big rise, or vice versa, and we leg out in accordance with our orig-\\n      inal motivation for doing the trade in the first place.\\n      Sell lower     Buy same           Buy higher    Sell same           Long Box\\n      strike put     strike call        strike put    strike call\\nSteps to Trading a Long Box\\n      1.

Sell same strike OTM call.\\n           Steps In\\n           ■   Identify clear areas of support and resistance that the stock, being volatile\\n               enough, will fluctuate between.\\n           Steps Out\\n           ■   Manage your position according to the rules defined in your Trading Plan.\\n           ■   Remember that the Long Box is a combination of other strategies, so it can\\n               be unraveled in two-leg chunks.\\n           ■ You can unravel the position as parts of the trade become profitable or loss-\\n               making. Remember for tax purposes that a short option is taxed as a 100%\\n               gain until you buy it back to close the position, so this position should be\\n               handled with care, and professional advice is highly recommended.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 744,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 328,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/328.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"          ■    Never hold the long options into the last month before expiration.\\n               Remember to include all the commissions in your calculations.\\n7.12.2 Context\\nOutlook\\n      ■   With long boxes, your outlook is direction neutral.

Having a\\n     sound and well-rehearsed Trading Plan is the key to our success. We can become\\n     proficient at playing just one stock, chart pattern, or indicator.

In order to\\n     reverse the position, you effectively buy back the asset that you sold short.\\n         There are times where we may have multiple positions open on the same securi-\\n     ty or index. Why could this be the case? Well, we could be long a stock on the week-\\n     ly chart but also doing a short-term positional trade on the dailies. Whatever the\\n     case, it’s possible for us to have both long and short positions on the same security.\\n     For these types of situations, regardless of how we’re classifying the individual\\n     trades, the tax classification may conspire against our better interests by treating the\\n     long and short positions of the same security as “constructive sales.”\\nExample 8c\\n     January 20, 2004                 You buy 1,000 shares of ABCD at $20.00\\n     March 18, 2004                   You short 1,000 shares of ABCD at $25.00\\n     Even though you may have meant to keep two open positions on this stock (one\\n     long position and one short position), this sequence of transaction could be treat-\\n     ed as a constructive sale, and you may be liable to short-term capital gains tax on\\n     the $5,000 “gain.” The treatment will depend upon the timing of the two transac-\\n     tions, price differentials, and how you close each position, though it is not straight-\\n     forward.\\n8.1.3 Wash Sales (or Bed and Breakfast)\\n     Many tax authorities have wizened up to the investors’ attempt to mitigate their tax\\n     gains by making the most of their losses. For example, say you have an investment\\n     portfolio of several stocks, but you are sitting on a pile of losses on one particular\\n     stock that you want to retain for the medium to long term. What you would do is\\n     sell the loss-making stock to take advantage of those losses now and buy it straight\\n     back the next day (or soon afterwards). In the old days, if you did this towards the\\n     end of a tax year, you could utilize those losses and set them off in that tax year\\n     against your other profits.\\n         Unfortunately the benefits of bed and breakfasting have been eliminated all\\n     around the world in various ways. In the U.S., if you own stock, sell it, and then buy\\n     it back within 30 days, this is considered to be a “wash sale.” The capital loss is not\\n     recognized and therefore cannot be set off against other gains.\\n         How would you attempt to get around this? By selling a naked ITM put, which\\n     would mean you’d own the stock again as soon as you’re exercised.

It expires OTM and therefore is worthless, meaning a 100% loss.\\n       2. You sell the option for a profit or a loss.\\n       3. It expires ITM and you exercise your right to buy (call) or sell (put) the under-\\n           lying asset.\\n       These three situations give rise to different taxation situations:\\n       1. If the option expires OTM, it is worthless, meaning you have made a 100%\\n           loss. In the absence of another related position, you would be able to set off\\n           that 100% loss against other gains.\\n       2. If you sell the option for a profit or loss, you will be subject to the long-term or\\n           short-term capital gains rules as set out earlier, depending on whether you\\n           held the option for more than 12 months.\\n       3. If you exercise a call option, then you will be buying stock. The cost of the call\\n           option you bought is added to the strike price at which you’re buying the\\n           stock, and the holding period for the stock starts on the day after exercise.\\nExample 8d\\nAugust 20, 2003      You buy ten $30.00 strike LEAP call option contracts of ABCD             $5,000\\n                     stock expiring in January 2005 for $5.00.\\nJanuary 21, 2005     The stock is worth $40.00, meaning your call option expires with\\n                     $10.00 of Intrinsic Value. This is a profit of $5,000 on your original\\n                     investment that you made 17 months ago (i.e., far enough away to\\n                     have made this a long-term investment).\\n                     Instead of selling the option the day before expiration and making\\n                     $5,000 profit with only 15% tax to pay, you decide to exercise the\\n                     option.\\n                     This means you now own the stock at $30.00 (the strike price), plus\\n                     the $5.00 you paid for the LEAP call option; i.e., a net cost of $35.00.\\n                     However, the holding period of the stock is deemed to begin the\\n                     day after exercise, meaning the clock only starts on January 22, 2005.\\n                     This means that until January 22, 2006, this is deemed to be a short-\\n                     term investment, taxable at 35%. If you decided to sell the stock\\n                     while it was still at $40,000, you’d still make your $5,000 profit, but\\n                     you’d be paying 35% on that, as opposed to the 15% you’d have\\n                     paid if you’d simply sold the option the day before expiration. That’s\\n                     $1,000 of your profit wasted by not understanding the tax situation.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 753,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 337,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/337.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"                                                      Taxation for Stock and Options Traders      297\\n       4.

Typically this would be a naïve thing to do. However, being\\n       aware of the intricate tax provisions enables us to consider possible occasions where\\n       early exercise may be beneficial.\\nExample 8e\\nJune 2, 2004          You buy ten $20.00 strike call option contracts of ABCD              $5,500\\n                      stock expiring in January 2005 for $5.50.\\nDecember 21, 2004     The stock price is now $30.00.

Your unrealized profit is\\n                      $5.50 ($5,500 in real dollars).\\n                      You’re happy with the profit, but you want to hold the stock for\\n                      the long term and defer the tax on the profitable option trade.\\nJanuary 20, 2005      ABCD shares are still at $30.00, but the option is now only\\n                      worth $10.00 (time value has evaporated). You exercise your\\n                      right to buy 1,000 ABCD shares at $20.00.\\n                      The basis for tax on the stock is now $20.00 plus the $5.50 you\\n                      paid for the call option. The clock starts on your new investment\\n                      tomorrow. Now you have to wait until January 21, 2006 in order\\n                      for the profit to be taxed at the lower (long-term investment) rate.\\n       Was the wait worth it? Well, only the future action of the share price will tell. If it\\n       continues to rise, then that 20% tax differential between short- and long-term invest-\\n       ments may become substantial. If ABCD falls, then you may have forfeited a per-\\n       fectly decent profitable trade purely in order to save yourself some tax.\\n          In summary, the rule is don’t let the tail wag the dog. Unless there is a spectacu-\\n       lar reason to do otherwise, base your investment decisions around your Trading\\n       Plan. Base your Trading Plan around fundamental, technical, news, options and any\\n       other indicators you feel are appropriate. Certainly be aware of tax implications, but\\n       don’t let tax get in the way of a coherent trading plan.\\n8.2.2 Short Options\\n       In the U.S., short options are not taxable when the position is opened. Closing the\\n       position (or the expiration of the option) always creates a short-term gain or loss\\n       regardless of how long the position was open.

There’s an earnings report due in five        $5,500\\n                       days, and you’re convinced there’s going to be a surprise. You’re\\n                       not sure which way the market will respond, only that there’ll be a\\n                       significant jump either way. You buy a $25.00 strike March 2005\\n                       Straddle, paying $2.45 for the calls and $2.15 for the puts, meaning\\n                       a total investment of $4.60.\\nDecember 31, 2004       Earnings were a bonanza, and the Street was completely caught\\n                        by surprise. ABCD shares have jumped $10.00 to $35.00, and your\\n                        Straddle has more than doubled in value.\\n                        Your puts are now worth only $0.15, and your calls are worth\\n                        $12.15.\\n                        If you sold your puts, you’d expect to be able to claim the $2.00\\n                        loss in this tax year. If you hold onto the calls, you’d expect to pay\\n                        the CGT on those gains in the next tax year. The problem is that\\n                        the IRS considers the two legs of the Straddle as “offsetting” each\\n                        other. Therefore, you will not be able to benefit from the loss you\\n                        made on the put until you close the other side of the straddle; i.e.,\\n                        the profitable calls.\\n       The rules of Offsetting Positions state that where two positions offset each other to\\n       create substantial diminution of risk, then certain tax restrictions apply to the setting\\n       off of one side’s losses against the other side’s gains. This rule is vital to understand\\n       if you’re considering a Long Box strategy, which in certain cases can be used as a\\n       brilliant tax strategy, depending on the tax legislation of the jurisdiction you’re\\n       trading in.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 755,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 339,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/339.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"                                                   Taxation for Stock and Options Traders        299\\n8.2.4 Synthetic Call (Also Known as a Married Put)\\n       With this strategy, you’re insuring the purchase of stock by also acquiring a put.

If the put expires, then the premium is added to the cost\\n       basis of the stock. Regarding the Offsetting rules (described previously), there is still\\n       some uncertainty as to the treatment of this strategy.\\n8.2.5 Covered Calls\\n       Being such a popular strategy, we might hope and expect the tax rules concerning\\n       covered calls to be easily interpreted and straightforward. No such luck! In the U.S.,\\n       the taxation rules governing covered calls are complicated and require considerable\\n       analysis.\\n8.2.5.1 Qualified Status\\n       Covered calls are categorized as either “Qualified” or not qualified. “Qualified” sta-\\n       tus means that, for tax purposes, the stock may be considered a long-term invest-\\n       ment if the appropriate conditions prevail. Unqualified covered calls result in the\\n       stock being taxed as a short-term investment as far as gains are concerned.\\n       The determination of “Qualified” status for a Covered Call is dependent on the\\n       following criteria:\\n        ■  Time to expiration.\\n        ■  The strike price in relation to the stock price, where the strike price is In the\\n           Money (ITM).\\nOut of the Money (OTM) Covered Calls\\n       Writing OTM covered calls presents no complications and does not affect the status\\n       of the stock. Therefore, if you hold the stock for more than 12 months, writing OTM\\n       calls along the way, when you come to sell the stock, it will be considered a long-\\n       term investment and gains will be taxed at the long-term investment rate.\\nIn the Money (ITM) Covered Calls\\n       Complications arise with ITM covered calls. As mentioned, there are two main cri-\\n       teria governing “Qualified” status: time to expiration and strike price.\\n          Generally, “Qualified” status relies on the fact that:\\n        ■  The option must have more than 30 days to expiration.\\n        ■  The strike price must be the first available strike below (ITM) the stock’s\\n           closing price the day before the trade was entered.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 756,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 340,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/340.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"Example 8g\\nJune 2, 2004      You buy 1,000 shares of ABCD stock at $36.50 and sell ten $35.00 strike July calls.\\n                  Is this Qualified or not?\\n                  ■ Days to expiration > 30.\\n                  ■ The strike price is the first available strike below $36.50.\\n                  Therefore, this does qualify as a Qualified Covered Call.\\nExample 8h\\nJune 2, 2004      You buy 1,000 shares of ABCD stock at $36.50 and sell ten $30.00 strike June calls.\\n                  Is this Qualified or not?\\n                  ■ Days to expiration < 30.\\n                  ■ The strike price is not the first available strike below $36.50.\\n                  Therefore, this does not qualify as a Qualified Covered Call.\\n          However, where there are more than 90 days to expiration, the rules become even\\n          more confusing, and this requires a table for explanation.\\nTable 8a\\nIn the Money “Qualified” Covered Calls\\nPrevious Day Stock Close            Time to Expiration      Lowest Qualifying Strike*\\nLess than or equal to $25.00        More than 30 days       One strike below previous day stock close\\n                                                            unless strike is less than 85% of the stock\\n                                                            price.\\n$25.01 to $60.00                    More than 30 days       One strike below previous day stock close.\\n$60.01 to $150.00                   31–90 days              One strike below previous day stock close.\\n$60.01 to $150.00                   More than 90 days       ■ Two strikes below previous day stock\\n                                                                close.\\n                                                            ■ Not more than $10.00 ITM.\\nGreater than $150.00                31–90 days              One strike below previous day stock close.\\nGreater than $150.00                More than 90 days       Two strikes below previous day stock close.\\n  * If the opening stock price on the day the option is written is more than 10% higher than the\\n    previous day’s close, then the opening price is used to determine the lowest acceptable\\n    strike price.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 757,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 341,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/341.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"                                                      Taxation for Stock and Options Traders     301\\nExample 8i\\nDecember 21, 2003    You buy 1,000 shares of ABCD stock at $36.50.                       $36,500\\nOctober 20, 2004      ABCD is now at $40.00.

Because the position was unqualified, your\\n                      stock holding period was suspended at 10 months.

Therefore,\\n                      the profits are taxed as a short-term investment; i.e., at the\\n                      higher rate.\\n       The bad news is that there are plenty more rules concerning trading taxes in the U.S.,\\n       even on covered calls alone.

The better organized you are at the time of your trades, the less time you’ll\\n       have to spend at the end of each year going over each and every trade.\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 758,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 342,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/342.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 759,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 343,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/343.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"A\\nStrategy Table\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"additional_content\": [],\n            \"book_id\": 10,\n            \"chapter_id\": -1,\n            \"id\": 760,\n            \"is_test\": false,\n            \"page_number\": 344,\n            \"pdf\": \"https://acusmart.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/books/10/344.pdf\",\n            \"test\": [],\n            \"test_name\": null,\n            \"transcript\": \"Strategy   Execution          Benefits                 Disadvantages            Component Parts Risk Profile\\nLong Call  Buy a call.

The benefits of options are often trotted out to\\n   new students or prospective customers as the first salvo of an up-sell campaign, but\\n   they’re worth looking at again, this time from a practical point of view.\\n       Options enable us to:\\n    ■   Control more assets for less money.\\n        One option contract represents 100 shares of stock and is usually a fraction of the\\n        cost of what you’d pay for the equivalent number of shares.\\n        For example, ABCD stock is priced at $26.20 on June 2, 2004.\\n        An option to buy ABCD shares (a call option) might be priced at $2.60. Because\\n        one contract represents 100 shares, we can therefore buy one ABCD call contract\\n        for $260.00 [100 * 2.60]. The alternative would be to buy 100 shares of the stock\\n        for a total sum of $2,620. So, in this example, we can buy ABCD calls options for\\n        around 10% of the stock price in order to control $2,620 of ABCD stock until the\\n        appropriate expiration date of the option.\\n    ■   Trade with leverage.\\n        Because our cost basis is so low, the position is much more sensitive to the under-\\n        lying stock’s price movements, and hence our percentage returns can be so much\\n        greater.\\n    ■   Trade for income.\\n        We can design strategies specifically for the purpose of generating income on a\\n        regular basis.\\n\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}"
